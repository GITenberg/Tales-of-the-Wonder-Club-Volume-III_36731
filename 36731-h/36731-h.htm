<h2>PREFACE TO VOL. III.</h2>


<p>Before taking leave of his readers, the author would
inform them that at the commencement of these
"Tales," the earlier ones dating some thirty years back,
nothing was further from his intentions than rushing
into print, although repeatedly persuaded to do so by
certain well-meaning friends, who from time to time
were permitted to peruse the hidden MSS. The tales,
nearly all of them, were written when the author was
living abroad, and to beguile a period of enforced
idleness, which otherwise would have been intolerable.</p>

<p>Never in his wildest dreams did he meditate inflicting
them on the public mind. Partly, it may be, that he
thought with Lord Tennyson, that "fame is half disfame,"
and that "in making many books there is no
end," as Solomon teaches. Or it may be that he didn't
care to augment that already numerous class who are
said "to rush on where angels fear to tread." However
this might be, time passed and the tales began to
accumulate, when the author conceived the idea of
stringing them together in a decameron, and later still<span class='pagenum'>vi</span>
of illustrating them with his own designs. Still years
rolled on, and the tales, long abandoned, were consigned
to the limbo of a mysterious black box, where they
remained all but forgotten till many years later.</p>

<p>"Why on earth don't you publish them?" was the
constant cry of those few who were taken into the
writer's confidence.</p>

<p>The author answered by a modest shrug of self-depreciation,
and still the unfinished MSS. lay at the
bottom of the black box. The fact was that a weight
of inertia oppressed him, added to a total lack of
experience in business matters of this kind, which prevented
him from taking the first step. He recoiled
from the thought of calling on a publisher and presenting
his own MSS., and being occupied in other
ways besides writing, he begrudged the time lost in
hunting up printers, publishers, and engravers, together
with all the delays <i>contretemps</i>, and disappointments
attendant on red tape.</p>

<p>What he wanted was a factotum, "an all round
man," who would take, so to speak, the dirty work off
his hands. Where was such a man to be found? He
knew of none. The author is a man of unusually
retired habits, and associates with but few of his kind.
By proclaiming his want openly, doubtless, many would
have presented themselves for the task, but in matters
of this sort a certain amount of intimacy with the
person employed seems to be necessary; at least, so
the author thought, and thus time rolled on, and the<span class='pagenum'>vii</span>
"Tales" were no nearer publication than they were
years ago, and might still have remained in this state
for years longer but for an unforeseen incident. One
morning, whilst taking a constitutional in a neighbouring
suburb, the author's attention was attracted by
a strange-looking stringed instrument of undoubted
antiquity, in the window of an old curiosity shop. He
would enquire the price of it. The proprietor, a weasel-faced
little man, with a polished bald head, foxy beard
streaked with grey, and a nose rather red at the tip,
stood at the door of his shop. His ferret eyes spotted
a customer.</p>

<p>"What is the price of that instrument?"</p>

<p>"One guinea."</p>

<p>"I'll take it. Wrap it up in paper."</p>

<p>"Right you are, sir. Good morning, sir. Thank
you."</p>

<p>And off trudged the author with this new acquisition
to his collection of curios.</p>

<p>Little did he imagine at the time what an important
part this same weasely little man was destined to play in
the drama of his every day life. Soon after this a
second visit was paid to the shop. It was a strange
place, choked with odd lumber, where any curio might
be obtained, from a mermaid to a mummy. A stuffed
crocodile hung in the window. There were cases of
stuffed birds and animals, dummies in costume, old
pictures, antique furniture, armour, weapons, coins, and
postage stamps. A third and fourth visit succeeded,<span class='pagenum'>viii</span>
and after almost every visit the author's collection was
enriched by some new curio. At length, so frequent
became these visits to the curio shop, that hardly a day
passed without the author putting in an appearance.
Some two years may thus have passed away, during
which time the author had ample opportunity of studying
this human weasel. He learned that he was a
bum-bailiff, a commission agent, etc., ready to undertake
any odd job for money.</p>

<p>Here, then, at last, was the very man. The author
accordingly propounded his plan of publishing the
"Tales." That weasel nose sniffed business. With
alacrity he seized the MSS., and donning a new top
hat, which he did whenever he desired to create an
impression of respectability, he climbed to the top of a
'bus, and was soon landed in the thick of our metropolis.
From that time all has been comparatively plain
sailing. "<i>Ce n' est que le premier pas qui co&ucirc;te</i>," and
cost it did, readers, you may be certain of that.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Gipsy Queen.&mdash;Mr. Blackdeed's New Play.</span></h4>


<p>It was Monday morning. Our members assembled
as usual at the breakfast table, after which the host
entered with the newspaper, to show his guests an
account of some political event of great importance.
The appearance of a newspaper in the club was a thing
of great rarity, as we have already hinted that politics
were only permitted occasionally on sufferance. As
Mr. Oldstone was commonly looked up to as the head
of the club, if not altogether on account of his age,
still as one who was most rigid against any infringement
of discipline and decorum, each member glanced
timidly towards this worthy, as if to ask his consent
and absolution, which having given with a solemn
nod of his head, the other members seized with eagerness
the mystic folio, and having spread it out upon
the table, huddled one behind the other to get the first
look at its contents.</p>

<p>As for our artist, he had "metal more attractive," as
Mr. Blackdeed might have observed. Nothing would
satisfy him but a good long sitting from his enchantress,<span class='pagenum'>390</span>
Helen. So stealing from the company, engrossed as
they were with their politics, he retired to his chamber,
where he set his palette; and, placing Helen's portrait
on the easel, he called his model, who came without
much pressing, and having placed her in the old carved
high-backed chair, he commenced work. The portrait
waxes apace. Our host's daughter is in her very best
looks. The painter's hand is inspired not merely by
the love of art&mdash;great, though that love undoubtedly is
with all artists&mdash;but spurred on by another, perhaps
more powerful feeling, which lends such temper to our
artist's ordinary faculties, as to render the painter himself,
a rare occurrence, utterly amazed at his own powers.
The first hour passes away like five minutes. Scarce a
word has been spoken on either side. To those who
feel they love, few words are necessary, and in many
cases, perhaps the fewer the better. This was a case in
point. Our couple loved. Why should we deny it?
How futile, indeed, for lovers themselves to deny it to
the world? How utterly hopeless a task it is for lovers
to attempt to conceal their love one for the other, even
<i>when</i> they intend to do so! Murder will out sooner or
later. In this, as in many other cases, love given vent
to in words could be productive of no good to either
party; and, therefore, as we said before, the fewer
words spoken, the better.</p>

<p>But what do I say? Will nature be subdued by
mere obstinate silence? Will not the trampled down
heart rebel and burst its fetters, seeking an outlet in the<span class='pagenum'>391</span>
powerful upheavings of the breast; the electric flashes
of the impassioned eye that the strongest efforts of our
feeble will in vain endeavour to render cold and indifferent;
the involuntary blush, the haggard cheek, the
pensive look; the smothered sigh&mdash;have they no language?
Nay, your very silence speaks for itself. Oh,
youth! if you would hide your passion, do so by flight,
there is no other way.</p>

<p>This is what McGuilp felt. As for Helen, poor
child, her virgin heart was a stranger to the tender
passion. She had heard of love, but just heard of it
vaguely as the world speaks of it, without being able to
realise its power. She would have been incapable of
analysing her own feelings, but a mysterious languishing
softness welled forth from her large blue eyes, which
whispered to the painter's heart things that it dare not
acknowledge to her own. Strange, awful, mysterious
passion; instilling thy subtle poison into the veins of
thy willing victims. Merciless poisoned dart! Swift as
thou art deep, inextricable as thou art unerring&mdash;who
can escape thee?</p>

<p>But let us leave the enamoured couple to themselves
for a while. Far be it from us to play the spy upon
their actions, and let us return to the club-room, where
the members, having exhausted their newspaper, are
interrupted in the midst of a political discussion by an
authorative thump on the table from Mr. Oldstone, who
reminds the company that Mr. Blackdeed has not yet
discharged his debt to the club&mdash;viz., the recital of his<span class='pagenum'>392</span>
new play, that he had just finished preparing for the
stage.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, the play, the play!" shouted several voices.</p>

<p>"Now then. Blackdeed," said Parnassus, "the play
is the thing, you know."</p>

<p>Our dramatist, with some show of modest reluctance,
or, as Mr Parnassus observed, "with sweet reluctant
amorous delay," produced his manuscript from his
ample pocket, inwardly, nothing loath to declaim his
late effusion before the august assembly, seated himself
with an air of dignity, and having waited till the whole
club was fairly settled, and all attention, he thus began:</p>

<p>
<span class="charnam">D. Sil.</span> In vain the consolations of deep science,<br />
The chiding voice of grave philosophy,<br />
To wean us from our earthly fond affections,<br />
When once deep-rooted in our bosom's core.<br />
Paternal love, surviving youthful passion,<br />
As autumn's deep'ning tints the summer's green,<br />
Remains mature till the cold wintry blast<br />
Of death hath scattered its last quivering leaf,<br />
And driven us, whither? I have a daughter,<br />
Than whom no saint in heaven purer is.<br />
Fair and virtuous Inez! Sole object left<br />
Me now to love on earth of all my kin.<br />
An old man's pride, and only legacy<br />
Of my late spouse, the sainted Dorothea.<br />
Who, giving birth to this fair angel, left,<br />
After ten years of childless married life,<br />
This, my poor helpless babe, but in exchange<br />
For her own precious self. Long unconsoled<br />
For this, my doleful loss, I sought once more<br />
<span class='pagenum'>394</span>Relief from sorrow in those studies deep,<br />
Abandoned since my manhood's prime, when I<br />
In Salamanca's university,<br />
Did strive for honors, my child consigning<br />
To a certain faithful old retainer,<br />
The good Rodriguez, who in lieu of mother<br />
Did rear the tender babe until it grew<br />
To years maturer, when I thought it fit<br />
To rescue her from out the hands of one<br />
Who, whatsoe'er her care maternal be,<br />
Is yet too full of vanity to make<br />
A good instructress to my only child,<br />
Whom I designed to educate in mode<br />
Far different from that in which Rodriguez<br />
And all her worldly tribe would seek to do.<br />
With this my aim in view, I took the child<br />
Away from home whilst yet her mind was tender,<br />
And placing her under my sister's care,<br />
The Lady Abbess of Saint Ursula&mdash;<br />
A convent distant thirty miles from hence&mdash;<br />
I left her until she should reach such age<br />
As maidens having made due preparations<br />
Are deemed fit to marry. Scarce sixteen<br />
Is now my daughter Inez; far too young<br />
To face without a guide the many wiles<br />
And dire temptations of this giddy world;<br />
I fain would keep her longer there, but then,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>395</span>Then comes the thought that harasses my soul.<br />
Having in youth squandered my patrimony,<br />
Wasting my substance that I might procure<br />
Expensive books and likewise instruments<br />
I needed in the fond pursuits of science,<br />
In gratifiying literary tastes,<br />
And other fancies, thus I soon became<br />
Deeply indebted to my richer neighbour,<br />
The valiant Don Diego, who, much loath<br />
To see an old house ruined, hath full oft<br />
From time to time with liberal hand advanced<br />
Such sums as I could ne'er hope to repay.<br />
This knew he, too, full well, and having seen<br />
Once my little daughter at the castle,<br />
And fancying much her beauty, thereupon<br />
Did make what he then doubtless did consider<br />
An offer fair and not to be refused<br />
By me, a desperate man&mdash;his debtor, too&mdash;<br />
An offer, namely, for my daughter's hand<br />
When she should have attained her sixteenth year;<br />
And this he gave me well to understand<br />
Would be the only way that he'd consent<br />
To counsel all my former debts to him;<br />
Refusing this, I knew th' alternative.<br />
Don Diego is a soldier fierce and proud<br />
As he is courageous, stern and merciless<br />
Towards those who thwart his will. What could I do?<br />
<span class='pagenum'>396</span>Unable to pay and in his power,<br />
Groaning 'neath a sense of obligation;<br />
Allured, too, perhaps, by prospects flattering<br />
In worldly sense to her, a poor man's daughter,<br />
I e'en consented. In an evil hour<br />
I gave my word to friend Diego,<br />
A man of my own years, whose castle stands<br />
Upon the opposite peak. Behold it.<br />
A man, I say, who might be her grandsire;<br />
Nor is it mere disparity of years<br />
That makes the gap to gape between the pair.<br />
Besides his age, and now decaying health,<br />
Don Diego all his youth has led a life<br />
The most licentious. Rumours strange and wild<br />
Are busy with his name, for it is known<br />
That he esteems the holy love of woman<br />
But as a flower to pluck and cast aside.<br />
He hath no reverence for religious rites,<br />
And thinks of matrimony but as a bond,<br />
Of all bonds easiest broke. With thoughts like these<br />
How shall it fare then with my poor daughter<br />
When once the knot is tied? His temper then<br />
Is stern and imperious, blunt and rude.<br />
Accustomed to command, he reigns alone<br />
Amidst a flattering troup of followers,<br />
Like petty tyrant, treating men as serfs.<br />
In boasting moods he vaunts of ancestry<br />
<span class='pagenum'>397</span>Who never thwarted were in lust or hate,<br />
And to this man shall I consign my daughter?<br />
No, no, it was an evil hour when I<br />
O'er hastily did consent to sacrifice<br />
My lovely Inez, purest of her sex,<br />
To this man's savage and rapacious lust.<br />
Repentance came too late, for he doth hold<br />
Me still to my promise, and all in vain<br />
Are pleadings of my daughter's tender age.<br />
The promise of her hand at some time hence,<br />
When she to riper womanhood hath grown,<br />
Excuse or promise unavailing both,<br />
For he, with military punctilio<br />
And lustful hot impatience, doth demand<br />
Her hand at once, and will brook no delay.<br />
He called on me of late, and from his mien<br />
I saw there was but little left to hope.<br />
A father's tears, as ever, failed to soften<br />
His all too stubborn nature, and at length<br />
He threatened me with ruin or with death<br />
And forcible abduction of my daughter<br />
If on a certain day ('tis now at hand)<br />
I gave not him my daughter for his wife.<br />
As yet my child knows nothing of this plan,<br />
But now the time draws near when she must know.<br />
How can I face my daughter? How can I<br />
With humble, piteous whine, say, "Inez,<br />
Thy father is ruined, an thou heed him not?<br />
<span class='pagenum'>398</span>Save him by the sacrifice of thyself."<br />
Or else, with imperious and austere brow,<br />
Say, "Inez, I command thee as a father<br />
To wed the man I've chosen thee&mdash;Don Diego.<br />
Obedience is a filial duty, and<br />
Thy father better knows what's for thy good<br />
Than thou thyself. At once prepare, obey!"<br />
Or should I, contrary to precepts taught<br />
Once by myself when she was yet a child,<br />
When I have preached 'gainst vanities and pomps,<br />
Empty frivolities and lust of greed,<br />
Can I now plead thus, and say, "Daughter mine,<br />
Behold what a grand thing it is to be<br />
One of the great ones of the earth, and move<br />
For ever midst the gay and high-born throng<br />
Of lords and ladies without care or pain,<br />
With means at hand to gratify each wish,<br />
To live the mistress of a noble castle,<br />
With serfs at thy command, with gold, with jewels,<br />
Dress at thy caprice, and hear around thee<br />
Ravishing strains of music in thy halls;<br />
Thy gardens, parks, and pleasure grounds rivalling<br />
Those of the noblest peers, exciting envy<br />

And recklessly give up thy giddy heart<br />

Throw not such a glorious chance away,<br />

Is this the strain that I could use to her<br />

Could she not answer, "Father, is it thou&mdash;<br />
Thou who dids't ever counsel me to shun<br />
The whispered words of gallants with the wiles<br />

That at thy bidding I might give my hand,<br />
Loathing, yet passively, unto a man<br />

Because this man has wealth and I have none?<br />
Is this thy virtue, father? This the end<br />

And would she not be right? Could I look up<br />
<span class='pagenum'>400</span>Into her angel's face unblushingly,<br />
And with a base hypocrisy reply,<br />
"My child, 'tis for thy good.  Such is the world."<br />
Would she believe me?  Would she not despise<br />
Me and my words, see through my selfishness?<br />
Yet what to do I know not. I am lost.<br />
Would not the world itself proclaim me base?<br />
Would not the mockers say, "Behold the sage,<br />
The philosophic, wise Don Silvio,<br />
He who despises wealth and this world's pomp,<br />
Yet sells his daughter for Don Diego's gold?"<br />
Thus run I counter both to God and man,<br />
And mine own conscience.  Crushing my child's heart<br />
That I might save my own grey head from ruin.<br />
Help me, ye saints! for I have need of guidance.      <span class="ralign">[<i>Kneeling.</i></span><br />

<p>How now, Rodriguez, did'st not hear me call?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Indeed, my lord, I came as soon as I<br />
Did hear you, but it may be that of late<br />
I have grown a little hard of hearing;<br />
Rodriguez now is getting old. How many<br />
Years is it I have served your lordship here?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Sil.</span> Cease thy prating tongue, and now lend thine ear.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> I'm all attention, good my lord, proceed.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Sil.</span> Well then, here is a letter I have written<br />
To thy young mistress, bidding her return<br />
With fullest speed to the paternal roof.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> What! my young mistress Inez coming home<br />
After full five years' stay within the walls,<br />
The gloomy walls, of grim St. Ursula!<br />
Poor soul! she'll scarce remember old Rodriguez.<br />
How I long to see her! How she'll have grown.<br />
Time will have wrought great changes. But a child<br />
She was when first she left her father's hall,<br />
And now returns a woman. Pretty dear!<br />
Shall I ever forget how she did cry<br />
<span class='pagenum'>402</span>At leaving me? For you must know, Se&ntilde;or,<br />
That ever with a mother's tender care<br />
I've cherished her as were she child of mine,<br />
And she, sweet soul, ne'er having known her mother,<br />
Looked for no other mother than myself.<br />
And mother she would call me when a babe,<br />
Until she grew and first began to learn<br />
The death of your good lady Dorothea&mdash;<br />
Peace be to her soul, the dear sweet lady&mdash;<br />
Then she learned to call me Nurse Rodriguez.<br />
Dear little soul! When I did see her last<br />
She had her mother's brow, her mother's hair,<br />
Her eyes, too, and her tiny foot and hand;<br />
Her smile was all her mother's, yet methinks<br />
Something about the nose and mouth and chin<br />
Was from your lordship. How I wonder now<br />
If she be changed, if she do remember<br />
How I was wont to dance her on my knee<br />
To still her cries with sweets, and how she'd ask<br />
Me to tell her all about her mother&mdash;<br />
How she looked and spoke, and how she dressed?<br />
I told her all I knew. What I knew not<br />
That straight I did invent to please the child,<br />
And oftimes on a chilly wintry night<br />
Of storm and tempest, when the lightning's flash<br />
<span class='pagenum'>403</span>Lit up with lurid glare the outward gloom,<br />
And the loud thunder, like to wake the dead,<br />
Shook the old castle walls to their foundation,<br />
On such nights as these, when sleep would desert<br />
Her downy pillow, I would lift her thus,<br />
And wrapping her up in my ample shawl,<br />
I'd draw her to the fire. Then, whilst the warmth<br />
Of the genial element diffused<br />
Itself throughout the chamber, rendering<br />
By the contrast of the black storm without<br />
Its growing blaze more grateful, then would I<br />
Beguile the night with tales of ghosts and ghouls,<br />
Of elves and fairies, and hobgoblins grim,<br />
Of witches, wizards, vampires, dwarfs, and giants,<br />
Pirates, brigands, and unburied corpses,<br />
Whose restless spirits, ever hovering near,<br />
Render the place accursed, and bring ill<br />
To happen unto those who wander there.<br />
Wraiths and doubles, and corpse candles glim'ring<br />
O'er unhallowed graves. Of secret murders,<br />
Of spells, enchantment, and of hidden treasure,<br />
Fights of knights and dragons, Christian damsels<br />
Rescued from Moorish captors by their lovers,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>404</span>Tales of the Inquisition and its tortures,<br />
Of dungeons dark and drear, and skeletons<br />
Found bleak and bare, laden with rusty chains<br />
That ever and anon at midnight's hour<br />

Of the wild gipsy tribes that roam these mountains,<br />
Of haunted houses and weird palaces,<br />

Of devils and of fiends&mdash;<br />

By giving reins to thine accursed tongue<br />
That thou hast sought to poison my child's mind?<br />
Is this why every eve when it grew dark<br />
I've seen her shudder and look o'er her shoulder?<br />
Why she would never enter a dark room?<br />
Why, as I've watched beside her tiny crib,<br />
I've seen her start in sleep with stifled sob?<br />
When I have watched her wan and haggard cheek,<br />
Her thoughtful mien, her dreamy vacant stare,<br />
Until I've fancied her in a decline,<br />
And feared she would not long be left to cheer<br />
<span class='pagenum'>405</span>My gloomy hearth; then was it this, I say,<br />
Thy foolish wicked lies, torturing thus<br />

You fill not her head with foolish stories<br />

Of my poor mistress, Lady Dorothea.<br />
What said he about my frivolous life?<br />
Who can cast a stone at Dame Rodriguez?<br />
Oh, his head's gone; that's very clear, alas!<br />
<i>My</i> life! 'Twere well he thought about his own,<br />
Spent here mid dusty books and parchments old,<br />
With dirty bottles and queer instruments.<br />
As no one ever saw the like before.<br />

Shut up here like a hermit all day long.<br />
A plague on him, and all his crotchety ways!<br />
Wait till my mistress Inez doth return;<br />
She will enliven him, and 'twixt us two,<br />
We'll make a clearance of this dusty cell.<br />
"Talk to her not of dress!" Poor silly man!<br />
Why, how on earth is the poor child to know,<br />
Shut up these five years in those convent walls,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>407</span>Of all the latest fashions of the day?<br />
How should she dress herself without the aid<br />
Of old Rodriguez? See how these men are.<br />
Do we live in a world or do we not?<br />
I should not do my duty to his child<br />
Were I to listen to him. No I must,<br />
The instant she arrives, take her in hand.<br />
"Talk to her not of gallants!" Why, forsooth?<br />
Must the poor child see no society?<br />
Is this hall a convent or a desert?<br />
Was she not born to marry and to mix<br />
With other ladies of her state and rank?<br />
How should she find a husband without me?<br />
She's growing up now, and has no mother,<br />
And as for her poor father, he'd as soon<br />
Think of flying as of his daughter's weal.<br />
No, no; but I will teach her how to cut<br />
A figure in this world as best becomes<br />
Her rank and station. I will teach her, too,<br />
What colours best become her, and how I,<br />
I, Rodriguez, figured once in youth,<br />
When I with train of yellow and scarlet silk,<br />
And stomacher of green, sleeves of sky-blue,<br />
First did meet my Carlos at the bull-fight.<br />
I'll teach her how to dress, to use the fan&mdash;<br />
Thus, also thus, and thus, and how to draw,<br />
With well-feigned coyness, the mantilla, thus,<br />
Across her face, leaving one eye exposed,<br />
And ogle, so, the gallants as they pass.<br />
<span class='pagenum'>408</span>A few good lessons taken from an adept<br />
Will soon prepare her for society.<br />

<p>
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Donna Rodriguez, an it please you, sir.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Ped.</span> Well then, be it so, Donna Rodriguez,<br />
I've just met master coming from the castle,<br />
Apparently in no good humour. He<br />
Asked me if you'd given me a letter<br />
Addressed to Donna Inez at the convent,<br />
And bid me thither haste without delay,<br />
Threatening me with mine instant dismissal<br />
Should Mistress Inez fail to arrive to-morrow,<br />
And thus with hasty step and moody brow<br />
He passed me by, as if old retainers<br />
Had not their privileges, eh? Rodriguez&mdash;<br />
Donna Rodriguez, I should say. Pardon me.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Here is the letter; you had best be off.<br />
Stay, Pedro. Did master look so savage?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Ped.</span> Even so.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span>          <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Something must have angered him.</span><br />
Prithee, good Pedro, hast thou not of late<br />
Noted a change in poor Don Silvio?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Ped.</span> Faith, I cannot tell. Since I have known him<br />
He hath been always the same moody man.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> But has he not of late seemed more estranged,<br />

Something of unusual import that<br />
Were hanging o'er him?<br />

<span class="charnam">Ped.</span>                     <span style="margin-left: 7em;">That's nothing new.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> I mean&mdash;save that of that old haughty Don,<br />
Old Don Diego from the neighbouring castle,<br />
Who ne'er vouchsafes me word, but when he comes<br />
Passes me by as the veriest slut,<br />
With not so much as "Good-day, Rodriguez,"<br />
But asks me sternly if my master's in.<br />
His visits have been frequent here of late.<br />
What think'st thou is the meaning of all this?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Ped.</span> In faith, I know not, and do not much care.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Ha! thou carest not? Come now, good Pedro,<br />
Wilt thou that I confide a secret to thee?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Ped.</span> A secret that shall increase my wages,<br />
Take more work off my shoulders? Then declare 't;<br />
If it be ought else, then keep your secret.<br />
I am tired of ever being the slave and drudge<br />
Of my old master for such paltry pay.<br />
I've served here now some twenty years and more.<br />
But matters were not always thus. I've seen<br />
The castle walls look handsomer in my day.<br />
In Lady Dorothea's time I never<br />
Had to wait for my wages, and my suit<br />
<span class='pagenum'>410</span>Was always clean and new. Then were there more<br />
Servants in the castle who took near all<br />
The work off my hands. Now that they're dismissed<br />
The burden of the household falls on me,<br />
And the wages, 'stead of waxing more,<br />
I have to wait for. I know not how long 'tis<br />
I have not seen the colour of his gold.<br />
Why, the castle's gone to rack and ruin.<br />
I am ashamed to meet my former friends,<br />
The well-fed menials of Don Diego's hall,<br />
When they with grave and supercilious smile<br />
Do thus accost me, "Ha! good man, Pedro,<br />
How fares it with thee and thy poor master?<br />
Thy suit, methinks, grows musty, like his castle,<br />
And, to speak truth, I once have seen thee fatter."<br />
Then straight they talk about their master's bounty.<br />
"Look how we fare," say they; "an I were thou<br />
I'd strike for higher wages or else leave."<br />
And all these taunts I have to bear&mdash;for what?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Well, well, I fare but as yourself; but hark&mdash;<br />
Something's astir within the castle.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Ped.</span> (<i>Turning round timidly.</i>)         <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where?</span><br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Bah! I mean something's about to happen<br />
In this old hall, an I do not mistake.<br />
A <i>change</i>.<br />
<span class='pagenum'>411</span><br />
<span class="charnam">Ped.</span>      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">For the better? Out with it, Rodriguez.</span><br />
Be quick, for with this note I must away.      <span class="ralign">[<i>Going.</i></span><br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Just so; the letter. What think'st thou there's in 't?<br />

<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Exactly; and canst divine the motive?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Ped.</span> Faith! Perhaps the charges of the convent<br />
Have grown too costly for the miser's purse,<br />
Or 't may be having stayed there her full time,<br />
She now returns unto her father's hall.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Not altogether that, for I well know<br />
Don Silvio would fain have kept her longer.<br />
Hark, Pedro! thou know'st that I've always been<br />
A faithful follower of this ancient house,<br />
And no time-server as some others are.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Ped.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Humph! That's meant for me. Time-server, forsooth!<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Ill would 't become a faithful old retainer<br />
Not to take interest in her lord's affairs,<br />
So with this sense of duty upmost, aye,<br />
And marking something most unusual<br />
In these frequent visits of Don Diego,<br />
Then hearing once his voice in angry tones,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>412</span>And that of our poor master, trembling, meek,<br />
I naturally bent my ear until<br />
It level stood with the chamber's keyhole.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Ped.</span> Naturally, Donna Rodriguez. Well?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Ha! Now you take more interest in my tale.<br />
Well, then I heard the whining piteous tones<br />
Of our old master's voice in broken sobs.<br />
"Think of her tender age, and your own years.<br />
Can this disparity between you both,<br />
This forced consent on her part, bring to her<br />
Ought but unhappiness? Prithee, reflect.<br />
Think of a father's feelings, and forbear."<br />
"Think of your debts, old man, and of your past,"<br />
Now said a sterner voice; "and if you fail<br />
To have your daughter all in readiness<br />
The next time that I call, so the wedding<br />
May be solemnised within my private chapel<br />
At whatsoever hour I please, hark ye!<br />

I can't think what our master's scruples are<br />
To such a union. Luck seems on his side.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Hush. You forget her age, the poor dear child<br />
Has scarce arrived at puberty, and then<br />
Knows nothing of the world, but cometh straight<br />
From that old convent without time to taste<br />
The sweets of life, or choose from out the crowd<br />
Of motley youths who <i>should</i> encompass her<br />
One of her choice, befitting more her age<br />
Than this grey, grim, and surly Don Diego.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Ped.</span> Don Diego is a proper gentleman.<br />
A trifle old, perhaps; so much the better,<br />
He will but die the sooner, and so leave<br />

May marry any gallant that she likes.<br />

<p>
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> 'Tis passing strange that all these five long years<br />
That I have lived within these convent walls,<br />
A stranger to the world without, unless<br />
To the narrow limits of our garden.<br />
I ne'er remember to have passed a night<br />
Like last night was. Most strange and fearful dreams<br />
Disturbed my slumber, robbing me of rest;<br />
Confused they were, and I can scarce recall<br />
Aught of their substance, but methought that I<br />
Was caught and roughly handled by rude men<br />
With dark ferocious faces. By their dress<br />
I should have deemed them gipsies; then methought<br />
I saw a female&mdash;tall, majestic, old,<br />
Or middle-aged, in strange and wild attire,<br />
Who spoke to me, and questioned me in proud,<br />
Yet calm and kindly accents, and that she<br />
Rebuked the ruffians, so that they fell back<br />
And did no harm to me; yet still I sat<br />
Surrounded by the band, which kept close guard.<br />
My fear was very great, so that I think<br />
I must have fainted, for I knew no more.<br />
It was a dream most unaccountable.<br />
<span class='pagenum'>416</span>My aunt, the Lady Abbess, says that dreams<br />
Are sent us oftimes by the saints to warn,<br />
Guide, and admonish us. That holy men,<br />
Ay, and women, too, have had many things<br />
Revealed to them in dreams and visions.<br />
Old nurse Rodriguez, too, I can recall,<br />
Oft would relate me hers, and would declare<br />
They all came true, or bore some hidden sense<br />
That none save gifted sybils could explain.<br />
And now, although my memory's much confused,<br />
Methinks Rodriguez formed part of my dream.<br />

It is my wish that thou at once take leave<br />

<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> And now, Pedro, do thou wait here until<br />
I shall return. I'll try not to be long;<br />
I've my baggage yet to pack, and to say<br />
Some words in private to our Lady Abbess.    <span class="ralign">[<i>Exeunt Inez and Lady Abbess.</i></span><br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Ped.</span> Why, how the little wench has grown, i' faith!<br />
But I'd have known her anywhere, I would,<br />
So strong is the resemblance to her mother&mdash;<br />
Her voice, her very manner too's the same<br />
As Lady Dorothy's when first I knew her.<br />
Ah, those were merry days. Would I could live<br />
Them o'er again. Let me see. What was it<br />
The gipsy beldam told me by the road?<br />
Ha! I remember. When about half-way<br />
<span class='pagenum'>419</span>Between the castle and St. Ursula,<br />
While jogging through a bleak and bare ravine<br />
Upon my mule, and leading on the other,<br />
A crone stood in my path&mdash;a gipsy crone.<br />
I know not how old; but past middle age.<br />
Still, from her mien, which was majestic, proud,<br />
I think she had been handsome in her youth.<br />
"Good morrow, Pedro," said the crone. "Speed well"<br />
"Good morrow, Dame," said I.  "You know me, then?"<br />
"And have done long. Gipsies know everything.<br />
Wilt have a proof of it? Wilt know thy fortune?<br />
Show me thy palm," she said. "My palm!" said I,<br />
"Know thou, good gipsy, I have nought withal<br />
To pay thee." "Never mind for that," she said;<br />
"I love to gossip with an old retainer.<br />
Thy gossip shall repay me. Quick, thy palm."<br />
Then tracing with her gaunt and taloned finger<br />
A mystic sign across the line of life,<br />
"Not always thus, good Pedro, hast thou been.<br />
Thou hast a master who but ill repays<br />
Thy manifold and useful services.<br />
Thou hadst a mistress once, but she is gone;<br />
With her decease good luck hath fled the house,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>420</span>But times will change, and luck will reappear,<br />
And thou shalt live content to good old age."<br />
I recollect no more of what she said,<br />
But mighty promises she made of luck.<br />
Then straightway she did ask me of my lord&mdash;<br />
How he fared, and also of Don Diego.<br />
"Excellent well," said I, and here I laughed.<br />
"Too well, too well, for one with head so white."<br />
"How mean'st thou?" she said, with searching gaze.<br />
"Why, marry thus!" said I; "they say Don Diego&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Hush, but this is a secret (here I winked)<br />
That old Don Diego, spite his years, doth think<br />
To take to him a young and pretty wife."<br />
Here the crone started somewhat, as I thought,<br />
And o'er her bronzed features came a flush<br />
Like burnished copper, and her eagle eye<br />
Flashed as with fire; but in an instant<br />
Her cheeks grew ashen pale and her lips trembled.<br />
Why I know not; but deeming her unwell,<br />
I offered her a sip of wine from out<br />
The gourd I carried at my saddle's flank;<br />
But she declined. "No wine," saith she, "hath ever<br />
Passed my lips since I was born. Shall I<br />
<span class='pagenum'>421</span>Break through my abstinence in hoary age?"<br />
Then seeming quite recovered, "Well," she said,<br />
"What was it of Don Diego, thou wert saying?<br />
Thou saidst, he thought to take to him a wife.<br />
Can this be true? Who may the lady be?"<br />
Then, mocking her, I said, "Thou knowest all things,<br />
Know'st thou not, the lady is our Inez,<br />
The daughter of my old lord Don Silvio.<br />
Still in her teens, and staying with her aunt,<br />
Lady Superior at St Ursula's,<br />
From here some fifteen miles, whither I go<br />
By order of her father, at full speed<br />
To carry back his daughter to his hall?<br />
And know'st thou not the wedding day is fixed,<br />
And all in readiness, but that our Inez<br />
As yet knows nought o't; but that to-morrow,<br />
When at eve I bring her to her father,<br />
She will soon learn it all, and willy, nilly,<br />
Will have to wed the old man for his gold?"'<br />
All this I told her. Then she said, "True, true,<br />
The stars already have revealed so much;<br />
But mark me, Pedro, mark me well, I say,<br />
For I know all things. It shall never be<br />
It will not happen. The stars forbid it."<br />
"What! Don Diego's wedding," said I. "We'll see."<br />
And off I trotted till I reached the convent.<br />

<div class="poem">
<p class="blockquot"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Don Alfonso</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Don Pascual</span>.</p>

<p>
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> Must thou then really leave me and return<br />
<span class='pagenum'>423</span>To Salamanca to resume thy studies?<br />
Alas! to think that thou shouldst go alone,<br />
And that I dare not bear thee company.<br />
Tell me, Alfonso, think'st thou the police<br />
Are ever on my track, or else that they<br />
Have now given up all strict and diligent search,<br />
Some weeks having passed o'er since the fatal deed?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Alf.</span> I would not counsel thee yet to return.<br />
Too many rash deeds have been done of late<br />
For the law to lie much longer passive;<br />
Besides, the man you murdered was a count,<br />
A great hidalgo, and of haughty race;<br />
His family will leave no stone unturned<br />
Until this murdered member is avenged.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> Murdered! say'st thou again? 'Twas in a duel.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Alf.</span> Murder or homicide, 'twill go ill with thee,<br />
An thou fall'st in the clutches of the law.<br />
In good time thou leftest Salamanca.<br />
But live and learn; I did ever tell thee<br />
Thou wast over ready with thy weapon.<br />
What! For a hasty word said in hot blood<br />
Must thou be ever quarte, and tierce, and thrust?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> Hold, friend, but you must know the case was thus&mdash;<br />
I met Count Pablo&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Alf.</span>               <span style="margin-left: 8em;">I know the story.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'>424</span>The count was stern and haughty as thyself,<br />
Nor made allowances for others' pride;<br />
He could not brook the independent gaze<br />
Of one whom, perhaps, he deemed of lower birth;<br />
This led to altercation and fierce looks<br />
(I own him wrong, for he began the quarrel),<br />
But it was thou who wast the first to challenge;<br />
And all for a word, too.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span>                  <span style="margin-left: 7em;">And was that nought?</span><br />
Nought, the being called a gipsy bastard?<br />
What! Call'st thou that a trifle? Bastard! Ugh!<br />
I swear, that had he been ten times my friend,<br />
I would have slain him. Bastard! Gipsy, too!<br />
What! Are we Spaniards of so fair a skin<br />
That he would have me pale-eyed, flaxen-haired,<br />
Like the barbarians of northern climes?<br />
May not a Spaniard have an olive skin<br />
And jetty eye without being gipsy called?<br />
A mystery, I know, hangs o'er my birth;<br />
I ne'er knew my parents. Some secret hand<br />
Doth forward me remittances at times,<br />
That I might be enabled to pursue<br />
My studies at the university.<br />
I cannot think it is my spurious father,<br />
For I do well remember me of one&mdash;<br />
Indeed, I think that she was not my mother.<br />
Although she treated me as her own son&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'>425</span>A lady of high rank and ample means,<br />
A widow, too, with kind and gentle ways.<br />
I knew not then that she was not my mother;<br />
But dying when I yet was but a child,<br />
I was put early to a seminary.<br />
It may be I inherited her fortune,<br />
And out of this expenses are disbursed.<br />
When young I made no strict inquiries<br />
As to my origin. Those around me<br />
Told me but little, but I think I heard<br />
I was adopted by this widow lady.<br />
More I ne'er cared to know, until of late,<br />
Being stung by the count's taunt of spurious birth,<br />
I challenged him and killed him in a duel.<br />
And now I fain would have the myst'ry cleared,<br />
E'en should the certain knowledge gall my soul<br />
And I in truth should be a gipsy bastard.<br />
It may be that he spoke the truth. But how<br />
Did he come to know of it? Or, if truth,<br />
That truth was spoke in insult, and so ta'en.<br />
He who would call me gipsy, let him fear<br />
My gipsy blood. Let who would call me bastard<br />
Prepare to feel the sting a bastard feels.      <span class="ralign">[<i>Touching his sword hilt.</i></span><br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Alf.</span> Chafe not thyself; the deed is done. No more<br />
Mar not the precious moments of our parting<br />
<span class='pagenum'>426</span>With fiery words, like braggadocio,<br />
Or vain lamentings of the fatal past,<br />
But let us rather draw unto the table,<br />
And o'er a merry flask of Val de Pe&ntilde;as<br />
Strive to forget all sorrow.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span>                     <span style="margin-left: 7em;">So say I;</span>      <span class="ralign">[<i>Seating themselves at the table.</i></span><br />
And here's to thy safe journey and return<br />
To thy most beloved Salamanca.<br />
And here's to the eyes that await thee there.<br />
Here's also to the delicate moustache&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Alf.</span> Enough, enough, my friend. Such toasts as these<br />
Keep for thyself. I've other ends in view.<br />
I have to carve my passage through the world,<br />
To which no syren's eyes must be a hindrance.<br />
Wish me but success in all my studies.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> Ay, so I do, Alfonso, from my heart.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Alf.</span> As to thyself, Pascual, as it seems<br />
Thou art but little formed for study, being<br />
Of a too warm and hasty temperament<br />
To find much solace in the student's page,<br />
Preferring lone rambles and sylvan sports<br />
To the uncertain fame a scholar seeks.<br />
To thee, and such as thee, the love of woman<br />
Thy ardent nature will not fail to find<br />
Out of the many one whom thou canst love.<br />
May she be virtuous as she is fair,<br />
And worthy of thy love as thou of hers.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'>427</span><span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> I thank thee, but as yet my heart is whole.<br />
May I dare hope yet that a time may come<br />
When a woman's love and a happy home<br />
To thee may not be all contemptible.<br />
Heigho!<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Alf.</span> <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Thou sighest. Sure thou art in love.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> Not so, my friend, not yet.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Alf.</span>                            <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Then wherefore sigh?</span><br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> Thou hast awoke strange mem'ries in my mind&mdash;<br />
Events long past that I'd but all forgot.<br />
'Tis nothing, thou'lt say&mdash;mere childish fancy.<br />
Prithee, friend Alfonso, tell me one thing.<br />
Dost really think I come of gipsy blood?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Alf.</span> What! Is it there the shoe still pinches? Ha!<br />
Fill up another bumper of this wine<br />
And wash down the word, else it will choke thee.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> Nay, I am serious, and would have thy word.<br />
Tell me in honour, now, what thou dost think.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Alf.</span> Bah! What matters it? Thou art somewhat dark;<br />
But, as thou well sayst, so are all our race.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> True. But what think'st thou?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Alf.</span>                               <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Faith! I cannot tell.</span><br />
Perhaps over dark for a Castilian.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> Ha! Say'st thou so? I've long thought so myself.<br />
And what confirms me in the thought is this,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>428</span>That ever since my earliest youth I've felt<br />
A strange affection for these gipsy tribes&mdash;<br />
A sympathy for their wild wandering life<br />
And fierce impatience at the cold restraints<br />
By which well-bred society doth cramp<br />
Our fervid passions. Friend, thou knowest me well.<br />
Thou sayest well I am not formed for study,<br />
That is to say, such studies as thine own&mdash;<br />
Th' intricacies of law, philosophy,<br />
The mysteries of theology, and all<br />
The lore for which you students sap your youth.<br />
My book is nature. In the open fields<br />
I've loved to lie at night and watch the stars,<br />
The various aspects of the changing moon,<br />
Or on the giddy mountain peak at morn<br />
To view the first beams of the rising sun<br />
As from the rosy horizon it climbs<br />
Up towards the purple zenith. At midday<br />
I love to rest me in the sylvan shade<br />
And watch the deer grazing on the rich turf,<br />
Or else in company of some jovial friends,<br />
Hunt these poor denizens from their peaceful haunts,<br />
And, heated with the chase, dismount and slake<br />
My parching thirst from out the neighbouring brook.<br />
<span class='pagenum'>429</span>Full oft in my wild wanderings I have passed<br />
Through desert places, where no dwelling was,<br />
And, overcome by hunger and fatigue,<br />
Have well nigh fainted, but in such cases,<br />
When human hospitality doth fail<br />
Nature comes to the rescue and procures<br />
Its roots and berries, sometimes luscious fruit:<br />
And thus I've journeyed often from my youth,<br />
Encountering many dangers in my path.<br />
Twice captured by the brigands, nor set free<br />
Without heavy ransom.  More than once<br />
I've 'scaped unaided from the blades of ruffians,<br />
But not unscathed, and fighting hand to hand.<br />
I've also fallen in with the gipsy tribes,<br />
And lived among them, too, in early youth,<br />
Till I became familiar with their tongue,<br />
Their life and customs, for when yet a child<br />
They stole me from my friends, whoe'er they were,<br />
But I was rescued, and the dusky tribe<br />
Were driven out from that part of the land.<br />
Among my early reminiscences<br />
I can recall the tall and bronzed form<br />
Of one who should have been the queen of them,<br />
For so I've heard her styled. I met her oft;<br />
And when I first remember her she bore<br />
A countenance as beautiful as day.<br />
I have not seen her now for many years.<br />
<span class='pagenum'>430</span>When last I met her I could plainly see<br />
That time and trouble and a roving life<br />
Had left their stamp upon her dusky brow.<br />
But I had nought to fear from <i>her</i>. The crone<br />
Would call me to her and caress me, too;<br />
Call me endearing names, and, as a proof<br />
Of further love, she gave this ring to me;<br />
Made me swear it ne'er should leave my finger,<br />
And that some day it would protect my life.<br />
For should I fall in with the gipsy band,<br />
On seeing this token they would let me pass<br />
Without let or hindrance, so she said.<br />
For years I have not seen the gipsy band,<br />
And therefore have not put it to the proof;<br />
But still I've kept my vow, and from that time<br />
I ne'er have doffed it. And now tell me, friend,<br />
If what I've just told you does not prove<br />
Me sprung from gipsy blood?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Alf.</span>                     <span style="margin-left: 10em;">We cannot help</span><br />
Our birth. What matters it our parentage?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> Thou seest not, then, what it is that galls me.<br />
List. If I be of gipsy origin,<br />
I must be likewise bastard, for whoe'er<br />
Did hear of legal marriage in a case<br />
Of love 'twixt Christian and a gipsy maid?<br />
Knowest thou not what the term "bastard" means?<br />
<span class='pagenum'>431</span>Could I once but meet my spurious father,<br />
He should account for sending me adrift<br />
And nameless through the world, or I'd know why.<br />
For know, whate'er my origin may be,<br />
I have been brought up as a gentleman,<br />
And hope to marry one of gentle blood.<br />
What proud Castilian family would mate<br />
A cherished daughter to a lineage soiled?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Alf.</span> I do acknowledge thy perplexity.<br />
But bastard though thou beest, thou'rt still a man.<br />
Would'st 'rase the bar sinister from thy shield,<br />
Or, what is much the same, cast it i' the shade,<br />
So that it appear not for the lustre<br />
Of thy many and resplendent virtues?<br />
Make thy name famous. Fame, however bought,<br />
Hath ne'er failed to win the heart of woman.<br />
A woman's heart being once securely won,<br />
The vict'ry's thine. Th' obstacles that follow<br />
Thou'lt find will not be insurmountable;<br />
I mean, to gain the parents' full consent.<br />
But he must fight who'd win. And now, adieu<br />
I have no time to tarry longer. See,<br />
My mule is saddled, and I must away.<br />
Detain me not, my friend, for I would fain<br />
Reach the adjacent township ere nightfall.<br />

<p>
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> Adios! He is gone. His ambling mule<br />
Has borne its gallant freight far out of sight.<br />
Farewell, Alfonso. Fortune be thy guide,<br />
Truest of comrades, best of counsellors,<br />
Ride <i>thou</i>, my friend, towards fame, whilst I, Pascual,<br />
Like Cain, must roam the earth, a vagabond,<br />
Flying the face of man, by man pursued;<br />
A price set on my head. Not merely bastard,<br />
But vagabond! What was't he said of fame?<br />
He mocked me.  Fame for an outlawed gipsy!<br />
An it be not such fame the gallows brings,<br />
Write me down lucky. Would not an attempt<br />
To bring my name to light sign my death warrant?<br />
My friend thought not of this. For such as I<br />
The monast'ry's sequestered cell were good,<br />
Rather than fame. But courage yet! I feel<br />
The blood of our dark race boil in my veins,<br />
And cry shame on my fears. Then fame be it,<br />
But not that fame Alfonso wrings from books.<br />
Not that for me. The valour of my arm,<br />
The patient wasting of my hardy frame<br />
<span class='pagenum'>433</span>Shall win the fame I seek. For I recall<br />
The words long spoken, and but all forgot,<br />
By that same gipsy queen when first she gazed<br />
Into my infant palm. "Hail to thee, child!<br />
For thou beneath a lucky star was born.<br />
Fortune," she said, "hath marked thee for her own."<br />
These are the words. I cannot choose, but trust.<br />
Shine out, my star, since thou dost lead me on,<br />

<br />
<span class="charnam">Hunt.</span> Then thus it came about, my liege. As I<br />
Was wandering, towards mid-day, among the<br />
Many rocks and fissures of these mountainous ranges,<br />
Armed with my carbine, in search of game,<br />
As is my daily wont, I came upon<br />
<span class='pagenum'>449</span>A deep ravine, yet hidden from my sight<br />
By thorns and bushes and like obstacles,<br />
When soon I heard the hum of human voices.<br />
The spot, if I may judge well, I should say<br />
Was half-way 'twixt St. Ursula's and here.<br />
Well, trampling down the brambles, I stood firm<br />
Upon the brink of a steep precipice;<br />
And lo! beneath me was the gipsy gang,<br />
And chief amongst them, one tall stately form,<br />
A woman's that would seem to be their queen.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Die.</span> (<i>Confused</i>) Ahem! Didst say the queen?<br />

And 'mongst the tribe I saw as captives, soon,<br />
A gentle damsel and young cavalier.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Die.</span> How, sayest thou, Sirrah? A young cavalier!<br />
Sure, 'twas an aged servitor you saw.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Hunt.</span> An aged serving-man, 'tis true, there was,<br />
And tightly-bound that he could not escape;<br />
I knew him instantly. 'Twas Pedro here,<br />
Don Silvio's servant.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Sil.</span> Alas! alas! 'tis true. I was in hopes,<br />
When the hunter spoke of a young gallant,<br />
That he had mistaken some other travellers<br />

<br />
<span class="charnam">Hunt.</span>  Well then, my lord, knowing good Pedro's face,<br />
I did presume that the young gentle pair<br />
Were visitors, bound for Don Silvio's castle.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Die.</span> (<i>Musingly.</i>) Young gentle pair&mdash;ahem! Well, man, proceed.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Hunt.</span>  I watched in silence, and they saw me not;<br />
But still, from out my ambush I did take<br />
The whole scene in, and it appeared to me<br />
That the young knight must have resistance made,<br />
For low he lay, sore wounded in the head,<br />
While ever and anon the gentle maid<br />
Would dress his wound, and gaze with tearful eye<br />
And such a fond affection on her knight.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Die.</span> (<i>Aside to Don Silvio.</i>) Traitor, thou shalt account to me for this.<br />

And see if there be traces of my daughter.<br />
Alas! alas! this hoary head is bowed<br />

Oh, Inez, Inez! What a fate is thine!<br />

And bearing towards the castle. Now I see<br />
The limbs of horses and the arms of men;<br />
The sound of human voices, too, I hear,<br />
And, as they still approach, the distant tramp<br />
Of horses' hoofs is plainly audible.<br />
And now, unless my eyesight play me false,<br />
Foremost among a file of glittering pikes,<br />
I do discern Don Diego's waving plume.<br />
'Tis he! and bearing at his saddle bow<br />
<span class='pagenum'>453</span>My mistress Inez. Oh, thank God! she's safe.<br />

<p>
<span class="charnam">D. Die.</span> (<i>Sotto.</i>) What work I had to quell the dusky band,<br />
And carry off my prize. God only knows<br />
How the black caitiffs fought! Like demons damned;<br />
Incited on by their own swarthy queen,<br />
My former love. Bah! why recall the past,<br />
The ebullitions of a youthful lust,<br />
Now five-and-twenty years agone and more?<br />
And that at such a moment, too, as this,<br />
When, acting bridegroom for the second time,<br />
I now do lay my heart and hand, my wealth,<br />
My land, and castle, all my fair domain<br />
At fair Inez' feet.  Poor Silvio's daughter!<br />
A few hour's more, and she will be my own.<br />
In my own private chapel at midnight,<br />
And not one minute later, there a priest<br />
Of my own choice, shall join our hands together.<br />
'Twixt this and then, I must so use the time<br />
<span class='pagenum'>455</span>To win her fairly, and by wiles t'efface<br />
The prejudice young hearts by Nature have<br />
Against old age. If needs be, I must use<br />
Dissimulation and well act the saint,<br />
That she may not give credit to the tales<br />
That idle gossip may have crammed her with<br />
Against my moral character. And now<br />
I do bethink me that the readiest way<br />
Of all to win her over to my will<br />
Would be to tempt with goodly bribe her nurse<br />
(What will not such a woman do for gold?)<br />
To speak some little word in praise of me;<br />
Talk of my love for her, my name, my fame,<br />
My wealth, my virtues. How this match of hers<br />
Will please her aged father. And again,<br />
Should she be coy, and wickedly refuse<br />
The fortune heaven has strewed along her path,<br />
Let her reflect upon the consequences.<br />
I would act fair with her, for I'd be loath<br />
To lead to the altar an unwilling bride<br />
In sight of all my vassals and retainers.<br />
Yet, an she yield not (for as yet it seems<br />
She looks with cold suspicion on my suit),<br />
Why, then; why, then, however loath to use it,<br />
Force must accomplish all when goodwill fails.<br />
I cannot well expect much help at sixty<br />
From youthful graces, as when first I wooed<br />
My gipsy queen. <i>There!</i> ever and anon<br />
From out the past these memories will arise,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>456</span>Like phantoms, threatening whether I will or no.<br />
Avaunt! begone! And yet I cannot choose<br />
But call to mind how, middle in the fray,<br />
The dead and wounded lying all around,<br />
Her dusky form arose before my path,<br />
And all undaunted stood with staff in hand<br />
And glance so terrible, I would as lief<br />
Meet with the King of Terrors face to face<br />
As that same virago. Yet there she stood,<br />
And with uplifted arm, in clear tones cried,<br />
"Traitor, beware! Thy star is on the wane,<br />
Think not to conquer always, for a hand<br />
Mightier than thine shall yet subdue thee.<br />
Blood is on thy hand. Thine own blood shall flow.<br />
The stars foretell thy downfall, so look to it."<br />
I heard no more, for I had barely placed<br />
My Lady Inez at my saddle bow,<br />
Mid smoke of carbines and the clash of arms:<br />
Myself with drawn sword cutting right and left,<br />
So could but pay slight heed to what she said,<br />
And set off homeward with my goodly prize,<br />
Leaving the baffled foe behind to moan.<br />
Yet, through the smoke and dust of horses' hoofs,<br />
Still, for a time, I heard the hellish cry:<br />
"Vengeance on the traitor! Vengeance, vengeance!"<br />
I know not why her words cut deeper than<br />
<span class='pagenum'>457</span>Had they been the words of any other;<br />
But from <i>her</i> lips they came with such a force,<br />
They seemed to rend the air, and enter deep<br />
Into the very caverns of my soul,<br />
Turning my blood to milk, so that my arm<br />
Fell nerveless to my side, and my good blade<br />
Did well-nigh drop from out my hand. But hush!<br />
It never must be known that Don Diego,<br />
Though old in years, quailed before tongue of woman.<br />
Bah! away with all fear of childish threats.<br />
And, swarthy hag! do thou thy devilmost.<br />

<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Proceed, my lord.  I'm all attention. Speak.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Die.</span> Know then that I love thy mistress Inez.<br />
Ay, with the passion of a younger man.<br />
Count not my age&mdash;the heart is never old.<br />
I've sought her of her father, and 'twas settled<br />
She should be mine on her arrival home<br />
After her studies at St. Ursula's,<br />
Ay, on the very day. So ran the 'pact.<br />
The marriage, therefore, I have said takes place<br />
This very night, at midnight, in my chapel.<br />
All is prepared.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span>             <span style="margin-left: 5em;">'Tis over soon, my lord.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Die.</span> Peace! peace! I'll brook no waiting, no delay;<br />
I've sworn it shall be so, and it shall be.<br />
What care I, think'st thou, if the wedding dress,<br />
Or this or that be ready, so <i>I</i> be?<br />
Thou knowest our acquaintance is but short;<br />
She scarce has seen my face. No matter that.<br />
Now listen. What I ask of thee is this:<br />
<span class='pagenum'>463</span>Do thou use all thy influence with the child,<br />
T'induce her to look kindly on my suit,<br />
And to her father's prayers and tears add thine.<br />
But leave her not until she do consent.<br />
And should she e'en at the eleventh hour<br />
Be obdurate, why then, as last resource,<br />
Tell her her father's life hangs on a thread.<br />
Say that his castle and all that he hath<br />
Will instantly be sold over his head;<br />
And he and she, and you two servants both<br />
Sent all adrift at once, to beg your bread.<br />
If that work not, then must I fain use force,<br />
And that were against me. So, Rodriguez,<br />
Kind Rodriguez, I pray thee do thy best.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> My lord, you ever shall have my good word<br />
What I can do I will. Albeit, I think<br />
Your grace is over hasty in the matter.<br />
A little time&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Die.</span>           <span style="margin-left: 6em;">No, faith, not one minute</span><br />
Past the hour fixed. So see to't. I will now<br />
Off to the castle, leaving thee one hour<br />
T'exercise thy powers of persuasion<br />
On thy young noble mistress. After that<br />
I shall appear again and try what I<br />
Myself can do to win her virgin heart.<br />
Use all thy art and strength. Till then, adieu.      <span class="ralign">[<i>Exit.</i></span><br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> A pretty fix, forsooth! <i>Use all my art!</i><br />
I love the dear child well, and would, I'm sure,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>464</span>Do all I could to help her to a state<br />
Worthy the better days of this old house.<br />
The Lady of Don Diego! That sounds well.<br />
Mistress of his castle and his servants,<br />
But wedded to a man who's old enough<br />
To be her grandsire! Had he been a gallant&mdash;<br />
Yet his money's good. Humph! I suppose I must.</p>

Did beat for me within that hardy breast.<br />
Why I know not. I, too, who never knew<br />
A mother's love, whose infant steps were led<br />
By other than a mother's hand. A good<br />
Kind lady, long since dead, adopted me,<br />
And dying, left me all her patrimony,<br />
Which hitherto has been doled out to me<br />
By guardians, until I should come of age.<br />
One Father Miguel, whom I seldom saw,<br />

But when I asked him questions of my birth<br />
I never got intelligent response,<br />

<br />
<span class="charnam">Gip. Q.</span> The tale is long and sad, but thou must hear.<br />
Be patient and lend an attentive ear.<br />
Know, then, that in Grenada's lofty range<br />
There stands a twin-peaked mountain doubly-crowned,<br />
With two grim feudal castles, old, yet strong.<br />
The owners of these fortresses of yore<br />
Were aye at feud, until at last the one<br />
Subdued the other. Ever since that day<br />
The victor's star in the ascendant seemed,<br />
For though in later times they turned to friends,<br />
Who had been foes, and were allied together<br />
In skirmishes with castles neighbouring,<br />
In which they came off gainers, still, the one&mdash;<br />
The larger and the richer one, I mean,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>468</span>The whilom victor of the other peak&mdash;<br />
Did e'er with haughty overbearing sneer<br />
Upon his humbler neighbour, and would bind<br />
The poorer lord with obligations strong,<br />
For favours often granted, till at last<br />
The lesser lord became dependent on<br />
The greater one, and ever poorer grew<br />
And more dependent, and so stands the case.<br />
Things will not long be thus. A change will come.<br />
The Fates predict it, and the proud one's star<br />
Already's on the wane.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span>                <span style="margin-left: 5em;">In sooth, good Queen!</span><br />
But tell me what has this to do with me?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Gip. Q.</span> Peace! It concerns thee much, as thou shalt hear.<br />
The father of the present owner of<br />
The richer castle, Don Fernando height,<br />
I do remember well when but a child.<br />
A warrior proud was he, like all his race.<br />
His son, the present lord, is like him. He<br />
Whose name I've vowed shall ne'er more pass my lips.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> Ha!<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Gip. Q.</span>     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Interrupt me not. Thou soon shalt hear.</span><br />
This lord, who shall be nameless, in his youth<br />
(He now is old) did love a gipsy maid,<br />
Who, in the freshness of her virgin heart,<br />
Returned his passion, being but a child,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>469</span>Whilst he, the villain, was a full-grown man<br />
Of forty years and over. Still he bore<br />
His years so lightly that he younger seemed.<br />
With passion fierce he wooed the gipsy maid,<br />
And pleaded in such moving tropes his love,<br />
That the young gipsy's heart&mdash;not then of stone,<br />
Though long since turned to flint&mdash;did melt, and he,<br />
Seeing his prey secure, did plot her ruin.<br />
But the child had a father, old and wise,<br />
Of royal blood, too, known as King Dj&acirc;bel,<br />
And proud, too, of his lineage and his race.<br />
He thought it lowering to true gipsy blood<br />
To mate with pale-faced Christians, even though<br />
'Twere to a Christian king and by the church,<br />
Drawn up with legal document and signed<br />
In all due form, and when he heard that I<br />
Did to a Christian's love lend listening ear.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> You? <i>You</i>, O Queen, then, were the gipsy maid.<br />
You're speaking of yourself. I understand.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Gip. Q.</span> (<i>Starting</i>) My tongue has tripped, and traitor turned. Why then<br />
Pursue my tale under false colours? Aye,<br />
Know that I, Pepa, was the gipsy maid<br />
Once beloved of that false Don Diego.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span>       <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Don Diego.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'>470</span><br />
<span class="charnam">Gip. Q.</span>                  <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Ha! My tongue has tripped again.</span><br />
I vowed that name should ne'er more pass my lips.<br />
Well, this false lord, with subtle wiles and arts<br />
Did so win my young heart, that King Dj&acirc;bel,<br />
Furious at first at what he deemed a stain<br />
Upon his lineage, threatened me with death,<br />
And would have killed me, had I brought dishonour<br />
On his fair name.  But deem not that I fell.<br />
I loved him&mdash;and how dearly! But he found<br />
That the proud gipsy maid, though young, would not<br />
Barter her honour.  Not for wealth untold.<br />
He then made promises that I should be<br />
Mistress of all his castle and his lands<br />
After his father's death. Till then, he said,<br />
Our match must be clandestine, as his father<br />
Would disinherit him were he to know<br />
That his son were wedded to a gipsy.<br />
Our plans were well nigh ripe, for oft we met<br />
In secret, and had full time to discuss<br />
Our future prospects, left quite undisturbed.<br />
But one day King Dj&acirc;bel, suspecting guile,<br />
Did lie in wait for us, and with drawn blade<br />
From ambush out did spring upon the pair,<br />
And straight did fall upon this haughty lord,<br />
The would-be dishonourer of his child.<br />
But Pepa threw herself between her lover<br />
<span class='pagenum'>471</span>And angered father, and so stayed the blow<br />
And clinging to him, ever called upon<br />
Her furious sire to spare the gentle lord,<br />
And bid him smite <i>her</i> breast if <i>one</i> must die.<br />
But Dj&acirc;bel loved his daughter, and did pause,<br />
Touched for a moment with her pleading prayer.<br />
When, seeing him more calm, the wily don<br />
Did straight, in full and flowing courteous speech,<br />
Declare his love for me, and how he sought<br />
Not to make me his minion, but his wife.<br />
But Dj&acirc;bel, answering with haughty scorn,<br />
Said: "Go back to thy castle, Christian lord,<br />
And wed some damsel of the pale-faced herd.<br />
No blood of thine must mar our gipsy race."<br />
The don's eye flashed. He would have spoken words<br />
Full of wild fury and deep bitterness;<br />
But Pepa interposed again, and flung<br />
Herself on bended knees before her sire,<br />
And begged her knight kneel too, and join her prayer.<br />
The don at first loathing much to grovel<br />
Down in the dust before a gipsy chief,<br />
Whom he esteemed a savage, yet did yield,<br />
And for my sake did bend his haughty knee.<br />
And thus we knelt together, clinging to<br />
<span class='pagenum'>472</span>King Dj&acirc;bel's robe and choked with sobs and tears,<br />
Did pray and plead, and plead and pray for long,<br />
But all in vain our pleading and our prayers,<br />
For dark as midnight grew King Dj&acirc;bel's brow,<br />
And stern his glance of cold and deep disdain,<br />
Saying: "Humblest thou thyself, O haughty don?<br />
Methinks thou might'st have spared thyself the pains.<br />
Rise from the dust. Thy prayers are but as the wind<br />
That blows against the granite mountain's side,<br />
Yet harms it not, nor will it budge an inch,<br />
E'en though it blow a hurricane. So I<br />
Remain unmoved by all thy puny prayers."<br />
Stung to the quick, and rendered desperate,<br />
The haughty don with one bound sprang erect,<br />
And darting lightning flashes from his eye,<br />
Blushing the while at having bent the knee,<br />
Humbling himself in vain, now cried aloud,<br />
"Have at thee, then, dark chief, for <i>one</i> must die.<br />
I fear thee not, and will not lose my hold<br />
Upon thy daughter, whom I love as life.<br />
Give her me, an it please thee, but if not<br />
I'll wrest her from thee, so do thou thy worst."<br />
Then straight the fray began. Each drew his blade<br />
<span class='pagenum'>473</span>And fell upon the other, whilst my tears<br />
And screams availed not, for the two were locked<br />
Firm in each other's grasp, and tugged and pulled<br />
In equal match, whilst I with streaming hair,<br />
Torn robe, and tearful eyes, did cry aloud<br />
For help in vain, till this poor frame, o'erwrought<br />
With multiplex emotions, did give way,<br />
And, swooning, I fell heavily at their feet,<br />
Grasping my father's garment in my fall.<br />
The fight was stayed awhile, and each took breath.<br />
"Look to your daughter, chieftain," were the first<br />
Words that I heard on wakening from my swoon.<br />
And soon as e'er my tongue was loose, I cried,<br />
In accents feeble still, "Oh, father, stay<br />
This wicked brawl. Say, dost thou love thy child?"<br />
With heaving breast and eyes suffused with tears,<br />
And choking sobs, I seized his hand, and cried,<br />
"Spare my young life. I love this Christian lord,<br />
An thou do aught to him, 'twill be my death.<br />
Canst see thy darling wither, droop, and die,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>474</span>Or, stung to madness, seek a violent death?<br />
Now mark well what I say, O most dread King.<br />
Shouldst thou be guilty of this Se&ntilde;or's blood,<br />
Know me no more for daughter, for I vow<br />
Or him or none to wed, and should he fall,<br />
And by thy hand, I too will follow next.<br />
The oath is sworn." Then from my father's eye<br />
A tear fell, which he brushing soon away,<br />
As if he deemed it shame for man to weep,<br />
And changing to a lighter mood, he cried:<br />
"Girl, thou hast conquered. Christian knight, thy hand.<br />
Let all broils cease between us. Thou hast fought<br />
And won my daughter fairly, showing courage<br />
Worthy a gipsy born. Therefore no more<br />
Will I withhold consent unto this match.<br />
But, mark me well, Sir Knight, this marriage must<br />
Be, though clandestine, legally up-drawn,<br />
That no base shuffling subterfuge may e'er<br />
In after years crop up to thwart the bond."<br />
Thus spake the king Dj&acirc;bel. My Christian knight<br />
Did vow upon his honour all should be<br />
Exact as nicest lawyer could require.<br />
Alas, for human villainy! What snares<br />
<span class='pagenum'>475</span>And wiles beset the simple, trusting heart.<br />
I loved him, and did lend a willing ear<br />
To all his schemes, spite my father's counsel,<br />
Suspecting nothing. What should I, poor child,<br />
Know of the world and all its hollowness?<br />
But King Dj&acirc;bel, suspecting treachery<br />
E'en from the first, and well upon his guard&mdash;<br />
For little trust he placed in Christian wight&mdash;<br />
Did stand aloof, and watched things from afar.<br />
"Now will I try the faith of this same knight,"<br />
He said, and with a frankness ably feigned,<br />
He bid my lord take all things in <i>his</i> hands,<br />
Saying he trusted him in all, but he,<br />
For his part, was a very simple man,<br />
Unskilled in the world's usances and all<br />
That appertains to life 'neath governments,<br />
'Pon seeing which, the wily Christian lord<br />
Straight sought to profit by his innocence;<br />
Betray the hand that trusted him, and thought<br />
The dusky king, the dark barbarian,<br />
Would fall an easy prey into his hands.<br />
Howbeit, King Dj&acirc;bel, like crafty foe,<br />
Though simple seeming, sent abroad his spies,<br />
Whilst he himself was absent.  From these men&mdash;<br />
Men whom he trusted&mdash;he was well informed<br />
That this proud don had formed the fell design<br />
That a false priest should join our hands together.<br />
<span class='pagenum'>476</span><br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> Villain!<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Gip. Q.</span>          <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thou speakest sooth, for villainy</span><br />
More base or perjured never sprang from hell.<br />
I thought he loved me, but I found too late<br />
He sought to spurn me from him soon as e'er<br />
His lust was sated. So he straightway wrote<br />
To some base profligate and spendthrift friend<br />
Who owed him money, promising that he<br />
Would cancel all his debt and yet advance<br />
Another round sum, if, peradventure,<br />
He should so aid him in his hellish plot<br />
As to enact the part of holy priest,<br />
And satisfy the claims of King Dj&acirc;bel,<br />
Whilst he himself should be no longer bound<br />
To me by law than it should seem him fit,<br />
E'en as I were but his base concubine.<br />
You see, he loved me not, e'en from the first,<br />
Despite his protestations, since he could<br />
In base cold blood conceive such dire deceit.<br />
But this I knew not at the time, nor all<br />
The foul devices of his reptile heart.<br />
But fondly thinking that he loved me as<br />
I then loved him, I listened to his suit;<br />
Nor was I undeceived, till, ah! too late.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> This is most monstrous! Noble Queen, I vow<br />
Your sorrows move me to forget mine own.<br />
I would I had the traitor by the throat,<br />
That I might show him once how I esteem<br />
<span class='pagenum'>477</span>Him and his villainy. Nay, 'tis a crime<br />
That calls aloud to Heaven for vengeance.<br />
Thou art nought to me Queen, but yet I feel<br />
The wrong done towards thee e'en as though thou wert<br />
My own true flesh and blood. I'd do as much<br />
E'en wert thou thrice mine enemy. I swear<br />
That should this traitor ever cross my path,<br />
Or he or the false priest (I care not which&mdash;<br />
Aye, both together, for 'tis nought to me),<br />
By Heaven I swear&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Gip. Q.</span>               <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Hold! Heaven's instruments</span><br />
Are ever preordained. Thou canst not move<br />

In time, and from that quarter Heaven wills.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> True Queen, but tell me more, I fain would know,<br />
What said your royal sire King Dj&acirc;bel?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Gip. Q.</span> Then list, and thou shalt hear how Dj&acirc;bel's spies<br />
Did intercept the lines that this false lord<br />
Wrote to his profligate and perjured friend,<br />
So that he received them not. But now mark<br />
What did my royal father? First he went<br />
To seek a Christian priest, long known to him,<br />
Albeit, unknown to this same haughty don;<br />
To him he showed the lines, and through his aid.<br />
<span class='pagenum'>478</span>Was writ an answer to this foul epistle,<br />
As coming from the friend of this false lord.<br />
This priest was father Miguel.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span>                       <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Ha! that name.</span><br />
Why beats my heart as it ne'er throbbed before?<br />
Say, what is this new light that bursts upon<br />
My whilom darkened soul? What power is this<br />
That stirs my thoughts within me? But proceed.<br />
I must, and will know more. Proceed, O Queen.<br />
My frame doth tremble in expectancy<br />
For thy next word. Tell me, oh, tell me if&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Gip. Q.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Already he doth divine what I would say;<br />
Be still, my heart, and give me strength to tell it.<br />
(<i>Aloud.</i>) This letter, then, by Father Miguel forged,<br />
Ran thus in substance. Making first excuse<br />
That sudden illness made him keep his bed,<br />
But though unable to oblige his friend,<br />
Did, ne'ertheless, not to disappoint him,<br />
(Hearing the case was urgent, and not knowing<br />
How long it might be e'er he should recover)<br />
He thought to do not wrong in sending one,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>479</span>A trusty friend and boon companion,<br />
One, Don Elviro hight, to act as proxy;<br />
This was the name that Father Miguel bore<br />
To mask his own. Then straightway he set forth<br />
T'wards the inn, from which the letter dated,<br />
The while my lord, who, reading in hot haste<br />
The letter through, and doubting not that he<br />
Were aught else than what the letter stated<br />
(To wit, Elviro, and no priest at all).<br />
So sure was he of this, suspecting nought,<br />
He fondly welcomed him, and many a joke<br />
They cracked together o'er the heartless scheme.<br />
Don Miguel acting well his part throughout<br />
With ribald jest, and oft full merrily<br />
Alluding to his tonsure newly shorn,<br />
Asked of his patron how he liked his garb,<br />
And if he did not look a priest indeed.<br />
At this his lord laughed heartily, and thus<br />
Time passed away till I should don the veil,<br />
And we were married before witnesses.<br />
The ceremony over, all passed o'er<br />
Right merrily, nor knows my lord e'en now,<br />
Not even to this day, that he is married.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> Well done, by Heaven! And Father Miguel hail!<br />
So was the base would-be seducer paid<br />
Back in his own base coin. This should e'er be.<br />
<span class='pagenum'>480</span><br />
<span class="charnam">Gip. Q.</span> Ay, but thinkest thou I knew aught of this,<br />
Or was partaker in Don Miguel's scheme?<br />
Oh, no; of this my father told me nought,<br />
Nor knew I aught of all this base intrigue,<br />
This would-be marriage false, by false priest blessed,<br />
Till later years; in fact, until the time<br />
That King Dj&acirc;bel upon his death bed lay.<br />
He then confessed to me the foul design<br />
By him so ably thwarted. But e'en then<br />
The traitor had abandoned me already.<br />
He thought his marriage false, and told me plain<br />
I had no hold on him. I sought my sire,<br />
And then the truth came out. The blow was great,<br />
To find myself abandoned and deceived<br />
By him I loved and trusted, e'en though I<br />
Knew well that I stood right before the law,<br />
He had no right to leave me, that I knew.<br />
'Twas heartless, as I then was big with child;<br />
His father, too, was dead, old Don Fernand,<br />
And I, by rights, his castle should have shared,<br />
As he had promised, but old King Dj&acirc;bel<br />
Did counsel me, "Be patient yet awhile;<br />
A day will come when thou shalt vengeance take.<br />
<span class='pagenum'>481</span>Nature hath made me prophet. I can see<br />
Now that my sun is sinking far beyond<br />
This earthly sphere, all that shall come to pass<br />
In future years. Delay thy vengeance, then,<br />
Still a few years, and I will be thy guide;<br />
I, Dj&acirc;bel, from over this side the grave<br />
Will guide thy steps and shape thy destinies<br />
Until the hour arrive." Thus spake Dj&acirc;bel,<br />
And falling back upon his rugged couch,<br />
Did breathe his last, clasping my hand in his;<br />
He now sleeps with his fathers. Rest his soul!<br />
And I, now left an orphan, and so young;<br />
Abandoned, too, by the base man I loved,<br />
How fared it with me, being then with child?<br />
The days of mourning for my father o'er,<br />
I could not keep my mind from wandering back<br />
To our first days of courtship, when my lord<br />
First wooed me, and did win my virgin heart.<br />
I dwelt upon the memory of his words&mdash;<br />
How he had promised me in days of yore,<br />
His father being dead, old Don Fernand,<br />
That I should mistress of his castle be.<br />
How had he kept his promise? Don Fernand<br />
Was long since dead, yet he no offer made<br />
About his castle, but did keep me e'er<br />
Within a little cottage that he built<br />
During his father's lifetime for me, when<br />
We first were married. Here I lived content,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>482</span>For he then oft would visit me, and when<br />
He came not, yet I had full trust in him,<br />
And waited patiently, beguiling time<br />
By tending flowers in my garden home,<br />
For this was aye my passion from a child,<br />
And thus the hours passed full happily.<br />
But one day, seeing my lord with murky brow,<br />
And not divining what the cause mote be,<br />
I, with fond heart and young simplicity,<br />
Did offer all that consolation<br />
That loving wife will offer to her lord<br />
In moments of deep sadness. But he spurned<br />
Me coldly from him, and when I did ask<br />
In what way I had my lord offended,<br />
Deigning no direct reply, made answer,<br />
He loved me not. I had no hold on him,<br />
Should ne'er be mistress of his father's hall,<br />
Our marriage being but a mockery,<br />
To last as long as it should please himself.<br />
He left me with a laugh of bitter scorn,<br />
Whilst I, as if by lightning struck, did fall<br />
Flat to the earth, and waking, sought my sire.<br />
Thou knowest how my father, dying, left<br />
A promise he would ever guide my steps<br />
In hour of vengeance; so I patience kept.<br />
Meanwhile our son was born. That son <i>art thou</i>!<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> Oh, mother! mother!</p>
<p class="right">[<i>They embrace and weep on each others' necks.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>483</span>(<i>On recovering.</i>)            <span style="margin-left: 3em;">I did half divine</span><br />
The truth from the beginning of thy tale,<br />
But at the name of Father Miguel<br />
My heart did smite so loud against my ribs<br />
As like to burst them; e'en as were it charged<br />
From Heaven with joyful tidings to my soul.<br />
I ever knew that man in some strange way<br />
Was mixed up in the mystery of my birth.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Gip. Q.</span> 'Twas he that christened thee, abandoned by<br />
Thy all unworthy father. He that holds<br />
Proofs that our marriage valid is by law,<br />
Without which proofs thou'dst been born a bastard,<br />
A stray, an outcast, slave to this world's scorn.<br />
The Lady Angela, that kind, good soul,<br />
Whose counsellor and priest Don Miguel was,<br />
Knew all thy history, and pitied thee.<br />
She was thy godmother while at the font.<br />
Don Miguel marked thee with the Christian's sign,<br />
And being a widow lady without heirs,<br />
And rich withal, she straightway did resolve<br />
T'adopt thee, and 'neath Father Miguel's care<br />
To have thee educated as a priest.<br />
Poor pious soul! But thou know'st best of all<br />
How thine own wilful temper at the school&mdash;<br />
Thy wild, impatient, roving gipsy blood,&mdash;<br />
Did give small promise for a like career,<br />
Which Father Miguel seeing from the first<br />
<span class='pagenum'>484</span>(Though not until repeated efforts made<br />
To tame thy stubborn nature proved in vain)<br />
Did finally, now weary of his charge,<br />
Abandon thee unto thine own wild ways,<br />
Doling the money out from time to time,<br />
Till thou should'st come of age. That time has come.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> Ha! ha! I well do call to mind the time<br />
When Father Miguel, with church dogmas sought<br />
To warp my stubborn brain, and if I asked<br />
Him to explain some of that lore he taught,<br />
And fain would burden my poor skull withal,<br />
Then straight it was a mystery. I must<br />
Have faith, he said; nor ask the reason why.<br />
Against this answer my young soul rebelled.<br />
And long and fierce the battles that we fought.<br />
He called me insubordinate and rude.<br />
Said I lacked discipline, humility,<br />
That I must subjugate my intellect<br />
Unto the church's dictates, threatening me<br />
With purgatory and everlasting fire<br />
Unless I thought as he did, branding me<br />
As atheist, Jew, or heretic, whilst I<br />
Called him a fool. Then losing all control<br />
Over his passions, this good, holy man<br />
Did raise his hand to strike me, seeing which<br />
I seized a knife and threw it at his head,<br />
Leaving a scar upon his cheek; then laughed.<br />
<span class='pagenum'>485</span>As I grew older matters mended not,<br />
So he sent me to a seminary,<br />
Thinking to curb my will by discipline;<br />
But they soon found the worse they treated me<br />
The worse was I, and so all gave me up.<br />
'Tis years since we have met. We were not formed<br />
To live together. Greater opposites<br />
In character Nature ne'er formed from clay.<br />
I owe the holy man no grudge; not I.<br />
He did his best, I mine to understand him.<br />
We were formed differently from our birth.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Gip. Q.</span> A wild boy thou wert ever. That is true.<br />
I've watched thee oft when thou thought'st me afar.<br />
Thou knew'st me not for mother, nor would I<br />
Unveil the myst'ry of thy parentage,<br />
Nor bring disgrace on Lady Angela,<br />
Who had so kindly offered to adopt<br />
Thee, the poor outcast gipsy's mongrel son,<br />
And rear him like the proudest of the land.<br />
Why should I, with my narrow, selfish love,<br />
Oppose a barrier to my son's advance,<br />
Refuse the lady's bounty, and drag down<br />
My son unto the level of myself.<br />
A wand'ring gipsy! Yet I loved thee. Ay,<br />
I loved thee e'en with more than mother's love.<br />
I would that all should love thee. As for those<br />
<span class='pagenum'>486</span>Who loved thee not, these I vowed should fear thee.<br />
I'ld see thee feared and envied, proud and great<br />
High up above thy fellows; and for this<br />
I smothered in my heart all outward show<br />
Of my affection, and so hid myself.<br />
Still, I was near and watched thee day by day<br />
Expand as the young plant before the sun.<br />
And I was happy in my heart of hearts<br />
To know that thou wert happy, and to know<br />
I was thy mother, though thou knew'st it not.<br />
And so for years I've watched thee, till thine own<br />
Wild wand'ring nature bid thee roam abroad.<br />
'Twas then for years that I lost sight of thee;<br />
This also was predicted by the stars,<br />
And so I gave to thee this gipsy ring<br />
That I might know thee when we met again.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> Ay, I do mind me well, when yet a child,<br />
How once a gipsy gave it me, and bid<br />
Me wear it ever, and 'twould bring me luck;<br />
And how I, childlike, straight returned home,<br />
Pleased with the gift, to show my mother, or<br />
The lady whom I thought my mother then.<br />
But tell me, queen or mother, which thou wilt,<br />
Why, if as I think, all thy tale be true<br />
And thou wert really married to Don Diego,<br />
Knowing the law to be upon thy side,<br />
Why didst thou not at once set up thy claim<br />
Of lawful wife, instead of waiting now,<br />
A score of years and more! Thou could'st have claimed&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'>487</span><br />
<span class="charnam">Gip. Q.</span> Thou askest me why I did not avail<br />
Myself of that protection that the law<br />
In my case would enforce. I'll tell thee, then.<br />
I was, indeed, then counselled so to do<br />
By Father Miguel and some other friends,<br />
Who knew that legal marriage was performed;<br />
But being mindful of the promise made<br />
Unto my father on his bed of death,<br />
And having strict confidence in his words,<br />
Those deep prophetic words which never erred,<br />
Then finding, too, when I did scan the stars<br />
Good reason his for bidding me postpone<br />
My vengeance for a season less ill-starred.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> What saw'st thou, mother, in the stars to make<br />
Thee to abandon all thy rightful claims<br />
And crave the charity of an alien?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Gip. Q.</span> I craved no charity. The lady who<br />
Did stand to thee in lieu of mother, came<br />
Herself and craved of me permission<br />
To take thee home and rear thee as her child;<br />
Which offer I, though with much reluctance,<br />
At length accepted, ever mindful of<br />
The brilliant future that the stars foretold.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> What sign was that that caused thee then such fear?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Gip. Q.</span> A star malefic in thy house of life;<br />
Threatening thee with speedy violent death<br />
<span class='pagenum'>488</span>From some traitor's hand. That hand, thy father's.<br />
Had I ta'en counsel of well-meaning friends<br />
And urged my rights, ay, had I moved a step,<br />
Thy life and mine had dearly paid for it.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> How this may be, I know not. If the stars<br />
Do really rule our destinies, or if<br />
Thy woman's fears but made thee dread contact<br />

<br />
<span class="charnam">Gip. Q.</span> Justice may be bought. The oppressor's star<br />
Was then in the ascendant. 'Tis no more.<br />
Now mark, and I will show thee how the stars<br />
Have worked and ripened for my just revenge.<br />
Thou knowest well, 'tis now full many years<br />
I have lost sight of thee, though I have learned<br />
From Father Miguel thou wast still alive;<br />
The stars foretold our meeting. Until now<br />
I've waited for thee, and the stars likewise<br />
Predicted that almost at the same time<br />
Another I should meet, whose destiny<br />
Did figure so in thy young house of life.<br />
<br />

And now he fain would marry her perforce,<br />
With or without her answer; he has sworn<br />
To wed her straight, scarce struck the midnight hour,<br />

This mockery of a marriage 'gainst the will<br />

Leave my young mistress Inez all alone,<br />
To brood and mope over her secret grief!<br />
Never! You ill know nurse Rodriguez, child.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) This is intolerable.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span>                                <span style="margin-left: 10em;">As you say,</span><br />
It cannot be about the gipsy tribe<br />
My darling frets. The danger's gone and past,<br />
Thanks to the noble conduct of my lord,<br />
The brave and gallant Don Diego, who<br />
<span class='pagenum'>498</span>At risk of his own life, with sword in hand,<br />
Did rescue you from the dark gipsy gang.<br />
'Twas bravely done. And how he wears his years!<br />
Just like a stripling&mdash;and how fine a man;<br />
How courteous, too, and what a merry eye<br />
He has for all his favourites. I'm sure<br />
That you yourself are one, judging from how     <span class="ralign">[<i>Inez draws back scornfully.</i></span><br />
He looks at you askance, then turns away<br />
And sighs so deeply, little thinking that<br />
Rodriguez guesses what he bears within.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> Rodriguez, silence! Of this trash no more.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Nay, Mistress Inez; pray not angered be<br />
With poor old nurse. She loves a jest at times.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> I'm in no jesting mood, I promise you.<br />
I pray you, leave me.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span>                  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">There you are again,</span><br />
Wishing me to leave you alone to mope;<br />
But, dear, Rodriguez better knows than leave<br />
Her little mistress all uncomforted.<br />
Away with nasty grief, and courage take<br />
From kind old nurse, and, like her, merry be.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> Your consolation, nurse, is, perhaps, well meant.<br />
Albeit, at present, 'tis superfluous.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> What! Hoity, toity! child; would'st have me see<br />
My little Inez pining and downcast,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>499</span>E'en though it be for nought at all; and ne'er<br />
Say word to cheer her? Nay, 'tis my duty<br />
To my mistress. So here I mean to stick<br />
Until I've made you laugh. Come now, madam.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) She's insupportable.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Were I a maid once more, I'd show you how<br />
I'd laugh and enjoy the world. Not as you,<br />
Pent up these years within a convent cell,<br />
Till you've grown musty. A pest on convents all!<br />
Keep them for cripples and incurables.<br />
For those who from birth so ill-favoured are,<br />
They find not husbands. These may chant and sing,<br />
And moan and fast, an't please them; but, for you,<br />
A maid of Lady Inez's beauty, jammed<br />
Within these walls&mdash;'tis sacrilege, I ween.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> Rodriguez, now you must not lightly talk<br />
Against those holy women, who have fled<br />
All worldly joys to win the peace of Heaven.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Each to their taste. For me, I love the world.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> I know it, nurse; but at your age 'twere fit<br />
You'd higher thoughts.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span>                   <span style="margin-left: 6em;">At <i>my</i> age! Pooh! tut, tut!</span><br />
Those with a merry heart are never old.<br />
Look at Don Diego, how he bears himself,<br />
And all because he has a merry heart.<br />
<span class='pagenum'>500</span>Had he been priest or monk, he had been old<br />
At thirty. But just look how proud his step,<br />
How clear his eye, how red his manly cheek.<br />
Were I a maid once more, just of your age,<br />
I straight should lose my heart, and that's a fact.<br />
Heigh ho!<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> A truce to this unseemly banter.<br />
Nor dare to name that man to me again.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> That man! What, poor Don Diego? In what way<br />
Hath he offended, that you treat him thus?<br />
I'm sure he is not conscious of his fault,<br />
Or he would die with grief; the dear, good man,<br />
Fond of you as he is, as all can see.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> Rodriguez, cease! I'll hear no more, I've said.<br />
And let me tell you, nurse, now once for all,<br />
It ill becomes thy years and sex, t'enact<br />
A part, of all parts most contemptible.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> What part, my pretty child? Don't so misjudge<br />
Poor nurse Rodriguez as to think that she<br />
Could counsel you for aught but for your good<br />
Remember, you are young, my mistress dear,<br />
And have yet to unlearn your convent life,<br />
That so ill fits you for our merry world.<br />
Your father, poor mistaken man&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span>                               <span style="margin-left: 13em;">Hold there,</span><br />
And reverence my father as thy lord.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'>501</span><span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Ne'er doubt me, mistress mine, but e'en my lord<br />
Would counsel you as I would counsel you.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> Thou speak'st of counsel. How would'st counsel me?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span>  Nay, then, nought 'gainst your interests; that's clear.<br />
Had I your youth and beauty, and your chance,<br />
I'd have a care, nor throw such chance away.<br />
Lend not the ear to ev'ry stripling, child,<br />
Because he's smooth of mien, but look behind<br />
The outer gloss, and seek for solid gold.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> Your counsel, nurse, is mercenary.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span>                                     <span style="margin-left: 12em;">Tut, tut.</span><br />
We've got to live; to live we've got to eat;<br />
Then comes our dress, our servants, and what else<br />
May appertain unto a lady born,<br />
As was your mother, Lady Dorothea,&mdash;<br />
Of blessed mem'ry,&mdash;when this ancient hall<br />
Looked livelier than at the present day.<br />
Now hark! my dear young mistress, and attend<br />
To these my words, as were they from the lips<br />
Of your own sainted mother, who looks down<br />
From her high post, and sees all that we do.<br />
What, think you, would your fondest mother say,<br />
To see this castle go to rack and ruin,<br />
Her darling child descend in social scale,<br />
Because she would espouse some popinjay.<br />
<span class='pagenum'>502</span>Whose wealth was all he carried on his back?<br />
When she could get a chance to marry one<br />
(A goodly man, if more mature in years)<br />
A great hidalgo, and of wealth untold,<br />
By means of which she could redeem this hall,<br />
And make it worthy of its better days;<br />
Pay off her father's debts, and thus content<br />
Him and his household, and all else beside.<br />
Why, marry, 'twere rank madness to let slip<br />
Such glorious chance, and such a chance have you.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> Enough.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span>          <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Nay, I <i>will</i> speak in duty bound,</span><br />
And tell you, willy-nilly, that the man<br />
Who thus would lay his riches at the feet<br />
Of my poor master's daughter is none else<br />
Than noble Lord Don Diego.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span>                      <span style="margin-left: 11em;">I have said</span><br />
I will not have thee mention that man's name;<br />
I did divine thy mission from the first,<br />
And doubt me not that thou wert amply paid<br />
To play the go-between; but learn for once,<br />
Base woman, that my heart must not be bought;<br />
The purest gift of Heaven was not made<br />
To be an article of merchandise.<br />
My heart's in mine own keeping, and must ne'er<br />
Be given up save to the man I love.<br />
Though this pile fall to ruins o'er our heads;<br />
<span class='pagenum'>503</span>Though hunger threaten; though my father's life<br />
And other lives at stake be; nay, e'en though<br />
This robe be turned to rags and I be sent<br />
Abroad to beg my bread, and from the cold<br />
Night storm or tempest ne'er a shelter find;<br />
Nay, come what will, nought 'gainst the will of Heaven<br />
Must e'er be done to suit the present hour.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Nay, speak not thus, young mistress, but be calm;<br />
Rodriguez, too, was once a girl and thought,<br />
E'en as you do now.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span>               <span style="margin-left: 8em;">More's the pity then</span><br />
That years, instead of bringing purer thoughts,<br />
Should cancel all the purity of youth.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span>  Nay, mistress mine, what I would say is this:<br />
That being in youth, even as yourself,<br />
More swayed by my heart than my interests,<br />
I gave my heart unto the man I loved,<br />
Disdaining higher offer, but soon found<br />
Cause to repent for having thrown away<br />
A better chance; for Carlos, when he saw<br />
That I had nought, and he had nought, he 'gan<br />
To lose the love he had for me, and then<br />
He beat me, and we quarrelled. Soon he died.<br />
And being left destitute, was fain t'accept<br />
The place of servant in your father's house.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> And by this tale of sorrows thou would'st prove<br />
That we in this life are in duty bound<br />
<span class='pagenum'>504</span>To sell our souls unto the highest bidder.<br />
Away with such foul subtleties, with which<br />
The arch-fiend baits his hook to tempt God's own.<br />
Give me the quiet of a convent cell,<br />
Rather than rank and splendour with disgrace.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Disgrace! Nay, honour. When the knot is tied<br />
You will be held in honour by the world.<br />
It is not mere protection that is offered,<br />
But legal marriage. There's the difference.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> The marriage that 'fore Heaven legal is,<br />
Is that in which two souls are joined in one,<br />
And not the forced and bitter mockery<br />
Born of man's interest, by him approved.<br />
Such match as thou would'st counsel were no match,<br />
But lust and policy combined in one;<br />
Most foul adultery in Heaven's eyes,<br />
Ay, e'en despite the blessing of the church.<br />
But, to cut short this most distasteful theme,<br />
Perhaps thou'lt tell me, as an after-clause<br />
Included in the pact, should I accept<br />
This offer that Don Diego deigns to make,<br />
'Twere necessary that this match take place<br />
This night at midnight, without more delay.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span>  Why, some such clause there is, I must confess,<br />
A mere caprice. What matters it? But then<br />
The offer is so splendid. Only think!<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'>505</span><span class="charnam">Inez.</span> In case of my refusing him. What then?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> You surely would not think of such a thing,<br />
If you knew how he loved you.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span>                         <span style="margin-left: 11em;">Still I ask,</span><br />
What's the alternative should I refuse?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> I would not counsel you to brave his ire.<br />
He loves you most devotedly, I know,<br />
And 'tis for that he'd hasten on the match,<br />
'Tis over-eagerness and fear to lose<br />
His prize. A groundless fear, I do admit.<br />
But he was ever an eccentric man:<br />
A good man though.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span>              <span style="margin-left: 7em;">So all I have to fear</span><br />
Is but his ire?<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span>            <span style="margin-left: 5em;">I know not though what form</span><br />
His ire might take. He's powerful and great,<br />
Accustomed to obedience, to command,<br />
Like all great military leaders who<br />
Hold up their heads above their fellow-men.<br />
He <i>might</i> use force. I would not you advise<br />
To thwart his will, but quietly to yield.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> And art thou woman, who would'st counsel me,<br />
Through fear of violence of mortal man,<br />
To so offend against all chastity<br />
As yield obedience to this man's lust?<br />
A veteran full four times mine own age,<br />
And that, in all hot haste this very night,<br />
When I have scarce had time to see his face!<br />
<span class='pagenum'>506</span>Is't this that thou call'st love? Now fie! Now fie!<br />
I did think better of thee, nurse Rodriguez,<br />
Than that thy tongue could have been bought for gold<br />
In such base cause. But since 'tis come to this&mdash;<br />
Away from me! and tell the fiend who sent thee,<br />
Inez would rather die a thousand deaths<br />
Than barter her virtue for all his gold.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> I dare not tell him so, my pretty bird.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> Then send him here, I'll tell him so myself.<br />
I fear no man when God is on my side.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> Nay, mistress, dear, forbear. You know him not.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> Yet thou would'st have me marry him. For shame!<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Rod.</span> I know not what to say. 'Twas urgency,<br />
Most dire necessity, that made me speak;<br />
Fear for your father's life, mine own, and Pedro's,<br />
And last, not least, yourself, my darling child.<br />
I am bewildered and half gone mad.<br />
What shall we do? Oh, Heaven grant us help.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">Inez.</span> I trust as ever in the help of Heaven.<br />
Sustain us, Lord, in our adversity,<br />
And let us lack not faith.      <span class="ralign">[<i>A knock at the door.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Oh, holy saints!</span><br />

Your mother will present herself anon,<br />

I have to aid me in this daring plot<br />
A tried and trusty friend, a mountaineer;<br />
This peasant hath across his shoulders slung<br />
A keg of choicest wine, by me well drugged<br />
With such a potent powder, that one drop<br />
But taken on the tongue were full enough<br />
In a few minutes to induce a sleep<br />
So dull, lethargic, heavy, and profound,<br />
That earth might quake, winds blow, and thunder growl,<br />
And yet the victims of this potent drug<br />
Would still sleep on, their long and death-like sleep,<br />
And much I doubt me if the archangel's trump<br />
Would fully wake them.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span>                <span style="margin-left: 8em;">'Tis not poison, father?</span><br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">F'th. M.</span> Nay, 'tis harmless. How could you think that I,<br />
As priest, could do aught to take human life?<br />
I come to hinder carnage, not to slay.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'>511</span><span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> This may be difficult, though, nevertheless,<br />

That bark and bellow at the foe's approach.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">F'th. M.</span> Leave all to me, my son. As for the dogs,<br />
I've poison brought, most instantaneous,<br />
With which I've baited meat, that I have now<br />
About my person, whilst this peasant here.<br />
What ho! Felipe!</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Enter a</i> <small>PEASANT</small> <i>with a keg of wine slung round him</i>.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">This same honest man</span><br />
Will go ahead with me, but as we near<br />
The castle we will separate, and choose<br />
Two divers paths, so that in case we meet<br />
With any man we seem not to belong<br />
One to the other. He will chant an air<br />
Such as our mountaineers are wont to sing,<br />
And go his way, as one who's light of heart;<br />
Myself, will pass on by another route,<br />
To meet the peasant at a given point<br />
Close to the castle and within the hearing<br />
Of all the soldiers; and if accosted,<br />
I have my answer ready.  Do not fear.<br />
When within hearing of the men-at-arms,<br />
I shall call out to this same mountaineer,<br />
As to a stranger: "Hold, friend. Where bound?"<br />
"To the next village, father," shall he say?<br />
"Trav'lling with wine. A buyer wants to try<br />
A sample, and I bring him of the best."<br />
<span class='pagenum'>512</span>"Ha!" shall I say, "then, prithee, let me taste.<br />
I, too, would buy a barrel, but for <i>me</i><br />
It must be good indeed, else, keep your wine."<br />
Then shall I feign to drink and smack my lips,<br />
Swearing 'tis nectar worthy of a king,<br />
And straight make offer to buy all he has,<br />
While trudging on together by the way.<br />
Presently we will come upon the guards,<br />
Some of whom know me well. Suspecting nought,<br />
These men will easily be lured to try<br />
The vaunted liquor. Having gone the round<br />
Of seneschal and warder and the rest,<br />
I shall find access to the castle hall<br />
Without much trouble, offr'ing as excuse,<br />
I come to let Don Diego taste the wine.<br />
Once entered fairly in the castle hall,<br />
Ere long all hands will sound as dead men sleep,<br />
Then shall I blow this whistle. At the sound,<br />
March on, and fear not, for the game is ours.<br />
<br />
<span class="charnam">D. Pas.</span> Hail! Father Miguel! once again I say.<br />

Transient, no doubt, but not the less unfit<br />
For gay festivity. The fact is that<br />
My youthful bride is of a temperament<br />
Too highly wrought and o'er hysterical.<br />
She only late hath left her convent cell;<br />
Her education, therefore, until now<br />
Hath rendered her unfit to face the world.<br />
Impressionable natures, as we know,<br />
Recoil before aught that can cause a strong<br />
And powerful emotion. 'Tis the shock<br />
They dread. 'Tis nothing. Nay, I do condole<br />
With her; ay, from the bottom of my heart.<br />
But yet I think it not well to indulge<br />
Young folk in such caprice. Therefore, should I,<br />
My honoured guests, be forced to assume<br />
An air of stern severity unmeet<br />
This gay assembly, deem it but as naught;<br />
'Tis firmness that is needed in this case.<br />

This trusting gipsy to accede to what<br />
Your own dark soul did lust for; thinking that<br />
'Twere easy work to dupe the innocent.<br />
So, writing to a worthless boon companion,<br />
Already in your debt, you promised him<br />
To cancel all his debt, and further add<br />
Another sum in recompense, were he<br />
To condescend to sink himself so low<br />
As to enact the part of priest in this<br />
False marriage. But that letter never reached<br />
<span class='pagenum'>521</span>Its destination. Dj&acirc;bel, gipsy king,<br />
This woman's father, once suspecting guile,<br />
As well he might, did send his spies abroad,<br />
And so this letter, fell into my hands.<br />
I quick conceived the plan to pen reply,<br />
As coming from the tool you sought to use,<br />
In which 'twas stated that he lay in bed,<br />
Ill of a fever, and so could not come,<br />
And therefore he would send a substitute<br />
To act for him. That substitute was I.<br />
I, Father Miguel, with dissembling mien,<br />
By you too fully trusted, had access<br />
Unto your presence, as you fondly thought,<br />
To help you in your plot of the feigned match.<br />

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>At the conclusion of the play our tragedian rolled
up his MS. and returned it to his pocket, while various
were the expressions of approval from the members of
the club.</p>

<p>All now seemed to look towards Mr. Oldstone for
his criticism of the play before pronouncing any decided
opinion of their own. This was a deference they paid
him as chairman, and because he was the oldest
member present. It was evident that this worthy was
accustomed to be appealed to in matters of importance,
and expected it in the present instance in particular,<span class='pagenum'>529</span>
for he had already stretched out his legs, thrown himself
back in his arm-chair, closed his eyes, and clasped his
hands together over his comely paunch, while his
thumbs performed a rotary motion, one round the
other, a sure sign with him that whatever his lips might
utter would be the result of deep thought and mature
deliberation. Our members awaited in silence the words
of wisdom about to issue from the lips of the oracle.</p>

<p>To fill up the time in the interim, Professor Cyanite
filled up a pipe of tobacco, and was about to light it.
Mr. Crucible drew out his snuff box, and was preparing
to take a copious pinch. Dr. Bleedem looked at his
watch, when suddenly a knock at the door caused the
members to raise their heads.</p>

<p>"Come in!" cried several voices at once. The
door opened, and Helen stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>"If you please, gentlemen," said the girl, blushing,
and with charming modesty, "Mr. McGuilp says that
he has finished my portrait, and would the gentlemen
of the club like to look at it before it gets too dark."</p>

<p>"Of course we will, my dear, of course we will,"
answered Mr. Oldstone, his fingers immediately unclasping
themselves and grasping the arms of the chair,
preparatory to rising to his feet.</p>

<p>"Come along, gentlemen." No further invitation
was needed. Professor Cyanite laid down his pipe
unlighted. Mr. Crucible replaced the grains of snuff, he
had intended conveying to his nose, back into his snuff
box, which he closed with a snap and returned to his<span class='pagenum'>530</span>
pocket. There was a general stir among the members,
who rose and followed Helen to the room upstairs, that
our artist had <i>pro tem.</i> transformed into a studio.</p>

<p>Jack Hearty and his spouse were already in the
room when the members of the club appeared at the
door.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's our Helen, to a T, and no mistake,"
he was saying. "Well, its just wonderful, and as like
her mother, when she was her age, as one egg is to
another. Eh? Molly," said he, addressing his spouse.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir. I hope no offence," continued
the landlord, turning deferentially towards our artist.</p>

<p>"But what might such a picture be worth, if I might
ask?"</p>

<p>"The wealth of the universe wouldn't purchase
it, my good host," replied McGuilp. "It is the best
thing I ever did, and that perhaps I ever shall do. No,
this one is not for sale. I do not say but that at some
future time I might do another from it, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this juncture, the members of the club, headed
by Mr. Oldstone, entered the studio. Our host and
hostess respectfully withdrew, in order to give the
gentlemen a better chance of examining the picture, but
even then the room was as crowded as an exhibition on
a private view day. Mr. Oldstone had placed himself
in front of the easel, and was soon loud in his expressions
of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Excellent! most excellent! Beautiful! beautiful!
beautiful! What flesh tints! What colouring! What<span class='pagenum'>531</span>
refinement of drawing and expression! As a likeness
it is perfect, there is no gainsaying. Then,
the pose&mdash;simple, graceful, and natural. My dear
young friend," he said, shaking our artist by the hand,
and seeming overcome by emotion, "Do you know
<i>what</i> you have realised? Why, it is the hand of a
master!" etc., etc.</p>

<p>Then each of the members in turn made their own
remarks upon the portrait.</p>

<p>"What a picture of life and health!" cried Dr.
Bleedem.</p>

<p>"What a face for the stage!" remarked the
tragedian.</p>

<p>"Ah! why was not I born a painter?" sighed Mr.
Parnassus.</p>

<p>The analytical chemist made a few scientific
remarks upon the properties of pigments, in which
Professor Cyanite joined, whilst our artist silently
removed the colours from his palette.</p>

<p>"And what do you propose doing with the portrait,
Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Mr. McGuilp?" inquired Mr. Hardcase.
"Keep it," replied our artist, laconically.</p>

<p>"What! <i>keep</i> it all to yourself!" exclaimed Mr.
Oldstone. "For your own selfish gratification, thereby
depriving others of the pleasure to be derived therefrom!
Mr. McGuilp, I am surprised at you. Gentlemen,"
proceeded the antiquary, addressing his fellow members,
"I protest against this decision of our young
friend. That picture does not leave this inn if <i>I</i> can<span class='pagenum'>532</span>
help it. Mr. McGuilp, your price. What is it? We
will all club together and buy it, won't we gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay! so say we all," cried several voices at
once.</p>

<p>"Impossible, my dear sir&mdash;impossible," remonstrated
our artist.</p>

<p>"<i>Impossible!</i> Why?"</p>

<p>"I feel I shall never surpass this," answered McGuilp.
"It is a sample work. I can make use of it in many ways
as a study. But this I will do. I will protract my stay
yet a few days, though I have already remained longer
than I intended, and I will make a copy of the picture,
which it shall be my pleasure to present to the honoured
members of this club." Murmurs of applause and
thanks followed this speech, after which the company
dispersed until dinner-time.</p>



<hr style="width: 80%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'>533</span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>The next morning broke dark and gloomy. Our artist
rose from his couch languid and unrefreshed. His face
was pale and haggard, with dark circles round his eyes.
What had transpired? Had he received a second visit
from the headless lady? Not so. What then? He
had slept indifferently, having been kept awake by his
own distracting thoughts. If he chanced to close his
eyes for a moment his peace was disturbed by the
most chaotic and depressing dreams. Was he unwell?
Did the fare at the inn disagree with him? He made
no complaints. Then why this strange squeamishness&mdash;these
wild chaotic dreams, through all of which <i>one</i> face
in particular seemed always to the fore? Sometimes
happy and smiling, full of life and health, then sad and
downcast&mdash;again looking at him with pleading eyes,
yet always the same face. Whose face this was we will
leave our readers to conjecture.</p>

<p>"Bah!" soliloquised our artist, as he placed one
foot upon the floor, "a chit of a girl like that, and at <i>my</i>
age too."<span class='pagenum'>534</span></p>

<p>He wasn't much past eight and twenty, true, but
then the girl running in his thoughts was barely
sixteen. In love? Not he. She was a dear, sweet
child, it was true, and pure as an angel; but her
education, her extreme youth, her position, her
surroundings&mdash;no, no.</p>

<p>Now he was quite out of bed. His shaving water
stood ready for him outside. He opened the door ajar,
and took it in. Then placing the jug on the table, he
proceeded to strop his razors. As he did so, he caught
a glimpse of his face in the mirror, and started.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, Vandyke, my boy," he said,
accosting his own reflection in the glass, "you are
looking worse than I thought. Come, cheer up, and
make the best of things. It would never do for the
members of the club to notice anything, and by putting
two and two together, guess at the reason <i>why</i>. No, I
must dissemble."</p>

<p>Now, men of the world are shrewd observers, and a
very slight clue is often enough. Here, for instance,
was a case of two young persons, both good looking,
being thrown together under circumstances peculiarly
favourable for a flirtation, being alone and unobserved.
Well, what then? Need they necessarily fall in love
with each other? Not <i>necessarily</i> perhaps, says the
world, but in all probability they <i>will</i>. Time and
opportunity alone being necessary to bring the matter
about. So the world may perhaps not be so very far
wrong in its deductions.<span class='pagenum'>535</span></p>

<p>Having now mixed up an abundant lather, McGuilp
rubbed it well over his chin and lower part of his face.
Then inserting his razor in the hot water, he, with as
steady a hand as possible under the circumstances,
proceeded to reap the hirsute stubble from its native
habitat until the operation was completed to his
satisfaction. Having at length finished his toilet with
even more than usual precision, he called up a cheerful
look to his countenance, and joined the rest of the
members at the breakfast-table, with an hilarity and
jocoseness of manner which took them all in.</p>

<p>The breakfast was sumptuous as usual. The table
groaned under every delicacy of the season, and our
members, having seated themselves, did ample honour
to the repast. A yule log blazed on the hearth, and a
general air of comfort pervaded the inn, as if to make up
for the murky weather without. Yet, despite these
creature comforts, and the hearty appreciation of them
by our members, there was one present whose appetite
failed him. In spite of his forced hilarity, which he
now found it difficult to sustain, for sad thoughts would
obtrude themselves, our artist but pecked at his food.</p>

<p>The fumes of the eggs and bacon sickened him.
The kippered herrings were an offence unto his nostrils.
He loathed such gross cheer. His toast and roll were but
nibbled at, his cup of coffee barely sipped, yet keep up
appearances he must. So he talked a good deal of
vapid nonsense, made trivial remarks about the weather,
etc., which served to put the rest of the members off<span class='pagenum'>536</span>
the scent, engrossed as each was with his own favourite
dish. The professional eye of Dr. Bleedem, however,
was more on the alert, and not so easily deceived.</p>

<p>"You are not looking so well this morning, Mr.
McGuilp," he said, eyeing his patient critically.</p>

<p>Our artist hastened to assure him that he never
felt better in his life. This remark, however, fell flat
upon the doctor's ears, and he proceeded as if he had
not heard him.</p>

<p>"You have eaten nothing. I notice that you only
play with your food. Now, when a patient plays with
his food, it is a sure sign that there is something wrong.
You should take&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't want any medicine, thank you,"
interrupted McGuilp. "I assure you I am all right. A
little loss of appetite, as you say; perhaps from the
sudden change in the weather, which always affects me
more or less. The fact is, I didn't sleep very well last
night, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can see <i>that</i>," continued Dr. Bleedem.</p>

<p>By this time the other members were getting interested,
and our artist found himself suddenly the cynosure for all
the scrutiny of the club.  How he cursed the doctor's
officiousness! Why couldn't he mind his own business?</p>

<p>"Yes, now you mention it, doctor, I can see that our
young friend does <i>not</i> seem quite up to the mark to-day,"
remarked Mr. Oldstone.</p>

<p>"By his appearance I should say the young gentleman
had something on his mind," suggested Mr.<span class='pagenum'>537</span>
Hardcase. "His countenance seems sicklied o'er with
the pale cast of thought," quoted Mr. Blackdeed from
his favourite author.</p>

<p>Then each member had something to say in turn,
till our artist felt himself blushing up to the roots of his
hair. In vain did he give himself a twisted pinch in
the fleshy part of his leg under the table. The blush
would rise, and there was no checking it. He fancied
he could see the members give side glances one to the
other, or trying to conceal a smile; but this may have
been imagination.</p>

<p>Breakfast being now over, each member rose from
the table, some gathering round the fire, one or two of
them peering out into the murky gloom. Then Helen
entered to clear away the breakfast things. She, too,
seemed less lively than her wont, her face paler, and she
went about her domestic duties mechanically, with
downcast eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, Helen, my girl," exclaimed Dr. Bleedem,
"you don't look as bright as usual. Have <i>you</i> been
having a sleepless night? Have <i>you</i> been losing your
appetite?"</p>

<p>The girl looked up confusedly, and a deep blush
suffused her face and neck. The fame of Dr. Bleedem
was great in the neighbourhood. She believed herself
to be in the presence of a man who could read the
secrets of her inmost soul, and that all attempts to mask
them from his scrutinising gaze would be worse than
useless.<span class='pagenum'>538</span></p>

<p>"What has come to you young people of late, I
don't know," continued Dr. Bleedem. "Now, here is
Mr. McGuilp, he, too, has been losing his appetite, and
suffering from insomnia."</p>

<p>Oh! how our artist wished that the ground would open
at his feet and swallow him up. In vain he trod on his
toes and turned his face towards the window, as if peering
into the snow that was now falling fast. His ears
continued to burn like fire, and all he could do, by
mopping his forehead with his pocket-handkerchief, was
inadequate to keep back the traitor blush.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" muttered Dr. Bleedem to himself,
whilst gazing from one to the other. "Is that the way
the wind lies?"</p>

<p>The members now began to look sideways, one
at the other. One of them raised his eyebrows;
another winked; a third suppressed a titter; but as this
all took place behind our artist's back, who was still
looking out intently at the snow, there was nothing to
wound his sensibilities.</p>

<p>At length Mr. Oldstone broke the silence. "When
are you thinking of beginning the copy of our Helen's
picture, Mr. McGuilp?"</p>

<p>"I? Oh yes, just so," replied our artist, waking up
out of a reverie. "Well, the fact is, we are most
unfortunate in the weather. It is impossible to begin
if it continues like this. Should it clear up later, I
will at once set to work."</p>

<p>"Good. And now gentlemen, what do you all<span class='pagenum'>539</span>
propose doing to while away the time? A rubber of
whist, a game of chess, backgammon, or what?" inquired
the antiquary.</p>

<p>After a little discussion, it was decided that Dr.
Bleedem, Professor Cyanite, Mr. Crucible, and Mr.
Oldstone, should form a party at whist. Mr. Blackdeed
and Mr. Hardcase played a game of chess, while the
poet and the painter, not being disposed to join in any
game, retired into a corner together, and were soon deep
in a discussion upon the arts of painting and poetry.
A couple of hours passed away, and still the members
were absorbed, each in his favourite pursuit, when the
weather began to clear up, and the sun shone brightly.</p>

<p>This decided our artist to set about his allotted
task; so breaking off the conversation with his poet
friend, he repaired to the studio, and placing a clean
canvas, the same size as that of the portrait, upon the
easel, he commenced his copy; and here we will leave
him to continue his task for the present.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>Over a fortnight had passed since we left our artist
at his work. The task was now completed. He had
found it necessary to have one or two extra sittings from
Helen herself on the copy, just to give more truth to it,
as he said. However, as everything on this earth comes
to an end, there was an end also to these sittings.</p>

<p>"Helen," said our artist to his model at the last,<span class='pagenum'>540</span>
"I must go. My affairs call me back to Italy. I have
been keeping my studio on all this time, and I have
certain business to settle which will brook no delay."</p>

<p>Helen's countenance fell, and her lip quivered.
Her eyes grew moist and downcast. In a voice that
she endeavoured to render firm, she ventured to inquire:
"And will it be for long, sir?"</p>

<p>"For very long, Helen? Perhaps for ever."</p>

<p>Helen had no answer to this. Her sobs were
choking her. The tears stole silently down her cheeks,
but she whisked them away with her handkerchief, and
did her best to appear outwardly calm.</p>

<p>Our artist, too, felt a lump in his throat, and his
eyes suffused with tears.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, sir," meekly suggested the girl, "when
you have settled all your affairs abroad, you may think
of taking a holiday, and be paying us a flying visit,
just to see Mr. Oldstone and the other gentlemen,
you know. I'm sure both father and mother will be
glad to see you again."</p>

<p>"I am afraid not, Helen. I am afraid not," and
our artist slowly and sadly shook his head.</p>

<p>"What! <i>never</i>&mdash;never again!" almost shrieked the
child.</p>

<p>Here she broke down completely. All restraint
and propriety flew to the winds. Nature, till now
trampled upon and held in abeyance, at this point
rebelled and relieved herself in a torrent of the bitterest
sobs and tears.<span class='pagenum'>541</span></p>

<p>"Helen! dear Helen! What is this?" cried
McGuilp, running to her assistance, his own tears
falling fast the while!</p>

<p>"Oh! what a brute I have been! Quick, rouse
yourself. There are footsteps in the passage. Somebody
is coming." Thus warned, there was a sudden
mopping of eyes and blowing of noses, when the door
opened, and Dame Hearty presented herself to ask if
Helen could be spared to assist her in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Oh! certainly," replied our artist, averting his face
and busying himself with putting away his palette and
brushes, whilst assuming a firm voice. "Yes," continued
he, still turning his back, "I think I may say that I have
finished with her now. This is the last sitting in fact.
There is the copy I intend to present to the club.
This one here is the first one, which I am going to keep
for myself. Which of the two do you prefer, Dame
Hearty?"</p>

<p>In this way he rattled on to hide his confusion.
Helen had slipped noiselessly away, bathed her face in
cold water, and returned to the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," replied Dame Hearty, in answer to our
artist's question, "I really don't know what to say.
They are both so lovely, there's not a pin to choose
between them."</p>

<p>Then, scanning our artist's countenance, she observed:</p>

<p>"You appear to have a bad cold, sir."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I have, Dame Hearty," said McGuilp;<span class='pagenum'>542</span>
"the weather has been very uncertain, and I think I
must have committed some imprudence."</p>

<p>"Let me make you a basin of gruel, sir. No? It's
a capital thing, and you should keep out of all draughts,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And keep my bed, perhaps you'll tell me, my
good woman," interrupted McGuilp. "No, no; I've no
time to coddle. Do you know, Dame Hearty, I must
be off to-morrow to London by the stage, as I have to
return to Rome without further delay. Already I am
long after my time."</p>

<p>"So soon! Why, you <i>have</i> paid us a short visit,"
exclaimed the hostess. "Well, sir, you knows best. All
I can say is that my husband and I will be most glad to
see you again, when next you be passing this way."</p>

<p>A knock at the door, and our host entered to ask if
he might be allowed to see the copy.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my good host, here it is," said McGuilp.</p>

<p>Jack Hearty went into ecstacies over it, saying he
didn't know which he liked best.</p>

<p>"Mr. McGuilp says he is off again to-morrow, Jack,"
began our hostess.</p>

<p>"Yes," broke in McGuilp. "What time does the
stage start? Early? I'd better begin my packing at
once," and off he went to his bedroom to make preparations.</p>

<p>The fact was, he wanted to be alone, for it was an
effort to keep up a cheerful appearance with a sad heart.
He locked himself within his room, and having collected<span class='pagenum'>543</span>
together a few articles of clothing&mdash;enough to fill his
valise, he threw himself into an arm-chair and gave
himself up to meditation.</p>

<p>It will be remembered a few pages back that our
artist accused himself of behaving like a brute towards
his model. In this he did himself injustice. He had
never deliberately set about gaining the affections of this
simple village maiden. Any base design against her
was the farthest from his thoughts. He admired her
innocence and beauty, and wished that it might never
lose its unsullied purity. He had never dreamed of
actually falling in love with her, child as she was, and
his conduct had been always that of a fond parent
towards a pretty child. He little recked of any danger,
either to her or to himself, but he found her beauty
gain upon him day by day, till at length he was fairly in
the toils. Yet he had never spoken to her of love. No,
not a word. He <i>would</i> not. He had no desire that
the girl should fall in love with him, nor would it be
politic for him to fall in love with her. Wrong her he
would not. Marry her he could not. For, besides
hampering himself as a struggling artist with a wife and
family, he dreaded quarrelling with almost the only
relation he had living: a rich uncle; from whom he
had expectations, and who would most decidedly consider
that he had dragged the family name in the mire
by marrying the daughter of a country innkeeper. In
what way, then, it will be asked, did he think he had
acted brutally towards the girl? This is what he blamed<span class='pagenum'>544</span>
himself for: First, for allowing himself to be carried
away with feelings of love towards the girl, however
secretly; and then for incautiously allowing her to discover
his secret. For, although he had not spoken of
love, you may depend upon it that he had <i>looked</i> it, and
it was not difficult for her to read in his burning glances
the secret of his soul. Love leads to love. He, too,
read in the soft eyes, the heaving bosom, the stifled sigh,
the deepening blush, and other tell-tale signs that she
loved <i>him</i>. Thus, each had learned the other's secret.
They had spoken to each other with their eyes, and
thus just as much mischief had been wrought as if the
most courtly phrases had been used. He had not
intended that his glances should be understood, but
they <i>were</i>. Thus he blamed himself.</p>

<p>Matters being thus, there was no other remedy but
flight. It would be a wrench, both for himself and for
the girl, but the kindest thing in the end. In fact, it
was his only course. So, having hurriedly finished his
packing, he went downstairs to inform the members of
the club of his intention.</p>

<p>It may easily be conceived how unwelcome was the
news, for our artist had made himself extremely popular
with all, and was looked upon as a great acquisition as
a story-teller. Mr. Oldstone, in particular, exhausted all
his powers of persuasion to yet delay his departure, but
he found him obdurate. The good antiquary, who was
an old bachelor, had grown to love our artist as a son; and
now that the hour of parting had come, it rent him sore.<span class='pagenum'>545</span></p>

<p>In the evening a farewell carousal was given in his
honour, in which several bowls of punch were discussed;
much tobacco smoked; a few speeches made; several
anecdotes related; a song or two; besides some atrocious
puns, with much laughter and witty conversation,
until the utterance of all grew somewhat thick; and we
regret to add that the worthy chairman, in his laudable
attempts to do honour to his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;, had to be
assisted upstairs and put to bed in a state decidedly
mellow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p>The next morning broke clear and frosty, without a
cloud in the sky.</p>

<p>"What bitter mockery!" thought McGuilp, as he
looked on the beaming face of Nature, and contrasted it
with the feelings he bore hidden in his breast. "A day
like yesterday would have been more in harmony with
my soul." The sun actually smiled on his departure.</p>

<p>"Good morning, my young friend!" cried the
cheery voice of Mr. Oldstone as they entered the
breakfast room together; "it is a fine day for you."</p>

<p>Our artist nodded assent, and having shaken hands
with all the members in turn, seated himself at the
breakfast table, and tried to keep up a cheerful appearance,
but his smile was hollow, and his face was pale.</p>

<p>"I wish you would let me give you a little opening
medicine, Mr. McGuilp," broke in Dr. Bleedem, in the
midst of a lull in the conversation; "it would soon set
you to rights."</p>

<p>Our artist persisted that he <i>was</i> all right, and
required nothing.<span class='pagenum'>547</span></p>

<p>"H'm, h'm," muttered the doctor to himself with a
shake of the head, as much as to say, "You don't fool
<i>me</i>."</p>

<p>Conversation then took a general turn, and our
artist was allowed to finish his meal unmolested.</p>

<p>Breakfast was hardly concluded when a horn was
heard in the distance. "There's the stage!" cried one
of the members.</p>

<p>"'The horn, the horn, the lusty horn,'" quoted Mr.
Blackdeed from his great poet; but the quotation fell
flat on the ears of our artist, who had grown a shade
paler.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure, Mr. McGuilp," went on the
irrepressible Doctor Bleedem, "that if you were to
follow my advice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, that's enough, Bleedem. Leave the boy
alone," broke in Mr. Oldstone. "Here comes the
stage. God bless you, my boy. Take an old man's
blessing with you. I know I shan't see you again this
side of Time. I'm getting old; I know it; I feel it.
But write me as soon as you get to Rome to say you
have arrived safely; and here is a letter to my old
friend Rustcoin, which please give him with your own
hands when you see him. There, good-bye, good-bye."
Here the kind old antiquary mopped his eyes, gave our
artist a fatherly pat on the back, and followed him to
the door.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, sir, and I hope we shall meet again."
This was all our artist could find to say.<span class='pagenum'>548</span></p>

<p>The coach had now driven up, and McGuilp had to
undergo once more the ordeal of shaking hands. This
was rather a trial, for although there could be no doubt
as to the sincerity of the regret that each member felt at
his departure, and the cordiality of their good wishes,
yet there was one thought alone that now occupied his
mind, viz., that of tearing himself away from his fair
model.</p>

<p>Whether the members guessed this, and out of bare
humanity wished to give him a chance to say a few
words alone with his lady-love, we know not; but,
having wished their guest God-speed, they left him, and
surrounded the coach. Some of them patted the
smoking horses; one had a word with the driver;
others seemed to scrutinise the travellers and the
vehicle. Our host and hostess stood at the door of
the inn, and wished their late guest a happy journey
and a speedy return, to which our artist responded by a
hearty shake of the hand and a few appropriate words.</p>

<p>The landlord was then called off to serve the driver
with a mug of ale, but before he went he called out to
his daughter, who was hiding herself behind her mother
in the passage, "Now, then, Helen, my girl, the gentleman
is going, and wants to bid you good-bye."</p>

<p>Helen now came forward, pale and trembling, while
Dame Hearty, perhaps guessing the state of things,
prudently retired, thus leaving the young couple to say
a word to each other in private.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Helen, my girl, and may God bless<span class='pagenum'>549</span>
you," was all our artist could trust himself to say at the
last; but his sad glance and the tender squeeze he gave
her dimpled hand spoke volumes.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, sir," faltered the child, now choking
with sobs; "good-bye, and may you be happy." Then
breaking down altogether, she rushed inside and was
seen no more. Our artist looked after her for a moment
as if dazed.</p>

<p>"Now, then, sir," cried the driver, "come along if
you're coming; we're off."</p>

<p>McGuilp, thus roused, threw his cloak around him,
pressed his hat over his eyes, and hastily mounted.
Crack went the whip, off went the horses, and our artist
was swiftly borne from the scene where he had passed
so many happy hours, midst cheering and waving of
hats, to which he graciously, but with an aching heart,
responded. He was now alone with his own thoughts,
and barely glancing at the shifting wintry landscape as
it flashed passed him, was in no humour to exchange
commonplaces with his fellow passengers. Here we
will leave him for the present, and return to our inn.</p>

<p>The members of the club, with the exception of our
antiquary, who had remained behind to finish a letter
for the post, had resolved upon a woodland ramble, and
were chatting lightly by the way.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; there is no doubt about the poor lad
being hard hit," said one. "I noticed it from the first."</p>

<p>"So did I," put in another. "In good time he
bolted, for these sort of things never end well when
allowed to go on ahead."<span class='pagenum'>550</span></p>

<p>"Of course, marrying her would be out of the question
altogether, looking at it from any point of view,"
remarked a third; "besides, there's her age. Why,
she's a mere child."</p>

<p>"True," observed a fourth, "and even supposing
her to have been of a marriageable age, he, being but a
struggling artist, wholly dependent on his profession,
and doomed to eke out a precarious living by the sale
of his pictures, what else but misery could there be in
store for either of them by such a union?"</p>

<p>But here we will leave them to continue their
ramble and their gossip.</p>

<p>It has been stated above that our antiquary had
remained behind to finish a letter. Having waved his
last adieus to his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and waited till the
coach had disappeared in the distance, he returned to
the breakfast room with a sigh, muttering to himself,
"Poor boy! poor boy!" He then collected his writing
materials, but the breakfast things had not yet been
cleared away.</p>

<p>Presently Helen entered, and proceeded to clear
the table. Her face was pale, but calm; her eyes
downcast. Our antiquary appeared not to notice her
overmuch, but was secretly scanning her countenance.
At length, when the table was quite clear, and Helen
returned with a fresh log for the fire, he slowly advanced
towards her, and placing his right hand on her head
and his left on her right shoulder, whilst he toyed for a
moment with her bright curls, he remained for some<span class='pagenum'>551</span>
moments in silence. The action was that of one invoking
a blessing. Then seizing her right hand in both of his,
and raising it to his breast, he gave it a gentle squeeze;
then dropped it and turned away, still without a word.</p>

<p>Now, poor Helen's heart was full to overflowing, in
spite of her outwardly calm demeanour. She was in
possession of a weighty secret, which seemed too heavy
for her to bear alone. Yet who was there to share it
with her? She had no friend of her own age to whom
she could open her heart and into whose sympathetic
ears she could pour forth her woes. Her parents,
much as she loved and respected them, did not seem to
her to be the sort of people likely to give her that
sympathy she yearned for. They would laugh at her,
reprove her perhaps, and tell her roughly to get all that
rubbish out of her head at once, etc. Not a soul had
she in the world to whom she could cling, or from whom
she could expect one ray of comfort. As to her secret
being discovered by the other members of the club,
this she dreaded most of all. She could imagine their
banter, their coldness, or their sneers. Dr. Bleedem,
too, who would prescribe her physic, and promise to
make her all right again, provided she followed his
course of treatment.</p>

<p>Love is by nature reticent, and not willing to make
its secret common property. Rather than divulge its
sacred feelings to the first light-hearted outsider it will
prefer&mdash;oh, how infinitely!&mdash;to bear its own burden
alone&mdash;aye, if need be, even to the grave.<span class='pagenum'>552</span></p>

<p>Never before in all her life did Helen need a friend
and comforter as she did now, when, lo, in the very nick
of time, there came to her this kindly old man whom
she had known from her earliest childhood, who had
dandled her on his knee, and never passed her without
a kind word. He, who seemed to have read her heart,
now came forward with his silent blessing, like an angel
sent from Heaven to comfort her. This was just what
she needed. This mute expression of sympathy from
someone whom she felt could understand her. She
construed his silence thus: "There, there, my pretty
child; we understand each other, don't we? You see,
I've guessed your secret, and you may be sure that it
will be safe in my keeping. I am not surprised. These
things are common to youth, and very hard to bear for
the time, but take comfort. Everything has its day.
This, too, will pass in time. Cheer up; try and forget
it. What! you can't? Oh, yes you will&mdash;not all at
once&mdash;no; but take courage. This is your first great
grief; but the world is full of trials, and we are sent
here on purpose to bear them. No one escapes them
altogether; but rest assured that you will always find a
friend and comforter in Obadiah Oldstone."</p>

<p>This, and much more, did the child understand by
the antiquary's silent magnetic touch. Her heart overflowed
with gratitude, and she was unable longer to control
herself, but, bursting into the most passionate sobs,
she covered her face with her hands and was making
for the door when Oldstone called her back.<span class='pagenum'>553</span></p>

<p>A Spanish proverb says, "He who loves you will
make you weep." Helen had proved the truth of this
adage.</p>

<p>"Come, my girl," said Oldstone; "am I such an
ogre that I need scare you? Come to an old man,
and pour forth all its pretty griefs. We used to be such
friends, you know. Did you think I didn't guess your
secret all along? We old men of the world have sharp
eyes, and very little escapes us. Well, well; I am not
surprised, you know. The young man who left this
morning was comely, and a gentleman, besides a man
of talent and resources. It is not difficult to understand
how a young and susceptible child like yourself, having
never seen anyone else but old fogies like us, should
suddenly take a fancy to a smart young&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! sir," broke in Helen, in agony, "he is gone&mdash;gone
for ever, and I <i>did</i> love him so."</p>

<p>"Love! my child! why, at your age you oughtn't to
know the meaning of the word."</p>

<p>"I didn't, sir, till quite lately. I had heard of it
from others, and read about it in books; but, oh! Mr.
Oldstone, I didn't know it was like this."</p>

<p>Here the poor distracted girl began beating her
breast with her clenched fist, and gazing upwards with
tearful eyes, in which there was an expression of the
wildest despair, till the kind old man began to be
seriously alarmed for her sanity.</p>

<p>"Hush! hush! my girl," he said in soothing tones;
"don't give way so. Calm yourself."<span class='pagenum'>554</span></p>

<p>"How can I be calm," screamed the girl, "when
he has gone for ever, and I shall never, never see him
again!"</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, and a good job too. The best
thing that could happen to you both," said the antiquary,
"though you won't think so now; but mark my word,
Helen, this will pass over, and the sooner the better for
you both, for these sort of cases lead to no good, you
may depend upon it."</p>

<p>"Why, sir," asked the girl, "is it then a sin to
love?"</p>

<p>"A sin, my precious!" exclaimed Oldstone; "no, I
can't say that. But&mdash;but&mdash;there is always danger in it."</p>

<p>"What danger, sir?"</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, there are certain things that are
very difficult to explain to one so young. When you
grow older&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! sir, why cannot you tell me now&mdash;you, who
know the danger?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, I should just think I did," observed
the antiquary. "There are shoals and pitfalls that
beset the young, and they would do well to listen to the
voice of warning ere it is too late, and profit by the
experience of others, rather than trouble themselves
about the <i>why</i> and the <i>wherefore</i> of everything."</p>

<p>"Then you mean to say that love <i>is</i> wrong after all,"
observed Helen.</p>

<p>"Not as long as it remains love," replied Oldstone,
"but people may <i>make</i> it so."<span class='pagenum'>555</span></p>

<p>"How? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, my dear. You have much to learn
yet. I mean, people <i>will</i> talk, and you can't stop them.
The world can only judge by appearances. It <i>might</i>
misjudge you. It might put a false construction on
your conduct, however innocent."</p>

<p>"But that would be wrong, unjust, and cruel."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, my dear. It very often is."</p>

<p>"Are the gentlemen of the club the world?"</p>

<p>"Yes, part of it."</p>

<p>"Would they tell stories about me?"</p>

<p>"If they thought they saw anything suspicious in
your conduct."</p>

<p>Helen reflected for a moment and then said, "I don't
know what they could find suspicious in my conduct."</p>

<p>"No, my pet, neither do I," answered the kind old
man with a benevolent smile. "The fact is, there are
so many people in the world who find other people's
business more interesting than their own; and even
when they are unable to find a flaw in their neighbour's
character, they will make one. Therefore, avoid the
appearance of evil."</p>

<p>"Still, I don't understand," began Helen.</p>

<p>"No, my dear, and what's more, I can't explain,"
observed the old man. "But <i>this</i> I can tell you. The
brute world, in cases of love, exacts marriage as the
hallmark of respectability. It can see nothing but
harm in the love of two young pure souls, however
platonic&mdash;I mean innocent. They look upon it as<span class='pagenum'>556</span>
dangerous, to say the least, and the only way to satisfy
them and avoid scandal is to <i>marry</i>."</p>

<p>"I never thought about marrying," said Helen.
"Cannot two persons love each other just the same
without either thinking of marriage?"</p>

<p>"They <i>could</i> I suppose, but the world would soon
make it hot for them. They would have to pay for
defying the world."</p>

<p>"Pay!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and dearly too. Pay for it by seeing the
finger of scorn directed towards them&mdash;the cold shoulder
of respectability and self-righteousness; by being forced
to listen to vile gossip and scandalous reports; shunned
by those far viler than themselves; bear up against the
ribald jeers of the vile populace, till their lives become
a burden to them, and they would finally be compelled
to confess that they would have done better for their
own peace and comfort if they had humoured the vile
rabble and <i>married</i>."</p>

<p>"Does love without marriage mean all that?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid it does, my girl; I am afraid it does.
At least, I wouldn't advise you to brave the world. It
isn't worth it. If you can't marry, you had better not
encourage love."</p>

<p>"I don't see that it matters to them if I love or if I
don't," observed the girl.</p>

<p>"Neither do I, my dear," answered her counsellor,
"and if people would mind their own business, the
world would be happier."<span class='pagenum'>557</span></p>

<p>"It seems so mean and paltry to be always prying
into other people's affairs. I can't tell why they do it.
I am sure I should never take the trouble. How is it,
Mr. Oldstone?"</p>

<p>"My dear," replied the old man, "I can't tell you
how these things are, but so they are."</p>

<p>At this juncture the voice of Dame Hearty was
heard calling for her daughter. The door then opened,
and the head of our hostess appeared.</p>

<p>"Come now, Helen," cried our worthy dame, rather
petulantly, "I have been looking for you all over the
house. You knew I was waiting for you in the kitchen."</p>

<p>"Don't blame her, mother," interceded the kind
antiquary. "It is all <i>my</i> fault. I have been detaining
her perhaps over long, just for a friendly chat."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, sir," replied the landlady with a
bland smile, "but if you don't mind me taking her
away now, as I am rather behind-hand with the work."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Dame Hearty," said Mr. Oldstone, with
a wave of the hand.</p>

<p>Helen followed her mother, and the door closed
behind them. Then our antiquary occupied himself
vigorously with his writing, until the other members of
the club returned from their ramble, hungry for their
mid-day meal.</p>



<hr style="width: 80%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'>558</span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>It is not our object to weary the reader with superfluous
details relating to the doings and sayings of the
members of the club, nor to follow up the story of their
lives from day to day. We will, therefore, suppose
some two years to have passed away since our artist's
departure for Rome. In two years' time much may
transpire, <i>i.e.</i>, in a large town where there is much
business and traffic. In this ancient hostelry, however,
situated about a mile from any habitable dwelling, things
went on from year to year in much the same monotonous
way. Jack Hearty was just as genial and attentive
as ever, and looked no older. Dame Hearty was just
as active, bustling, and good-humoured. And Helen,
what of her? Ah! here <i>was</i> a change. Was she
falling into a decline? Did her cheek grow paler and
paler, her step listless, her eye vacant, her manner distracted?
No; nothing of the sort. All these signs had
vanished long ago, thanks to a course of steel that Dr.
Bleedem had prescribed for her, and insisted on her
taking. What a feather in the good doctor's cap it was
when he saw the sallow, sunken face fill out, the rose of
perfect health once more return to her cheek, the<span class='pagenum'>559</span>
elasticity to her step, and the merry ring to her voice.
No wonder he blew his own trumpet. Who would not
have done the same?</p>

<p>But there was one among the members who smiled
quietly, and with an air of superiority, whenever the
doctor vaunted himself.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean, sir," said Dr.
Bleedem, one day, irritated at what he conceived to be
an expression of incredulity on our antiquary's countenance,
"but if you think that my medicine did not effect
the marvellous cure we have been discussing, I should
like to know what did, that's all."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," replied Mr. Oldstone, still with a
quizzical look in his eye, "I said nothing."</p>

<p>The doctor, far from being pacified, gave a snort,
then resumed severely, "And I'll tell you what it is,
Oldstone, if you don't take more care of your constitution,
you won't last much longer. You may depend
upon that. If you pass many more nights like that one
on the eve of Mr. McGuilp's departure, and think that you
know better than I do, your sand will run speedily down.
Then will follow a state of utter prostration&mdash;the death
rattle&mdash;the silent tomb. Ha! ha! how will you like
that?"</p>

<p>Having thus delivered himself, this son of &AElig;sculapius
felt better, and deeming he had completely vanquished
his antagonist, he proceeded to fill his yard of clay with
some of his most pungent tobacco, lighted it, and
throwing himself back in his chair, and crossing his<span class='pagenum'>560</span>
legs, gave several defiant puffs at his pipe, causing the
smoke to stream through his nostrils, which gave him
somewhat the appearance of a fiery dragon.</p>

<p>"Well, man," said Mr. Oldstone, meekly, "don't
croak like a bird of ill omen. It is like having the
skeleton at the feast, as was the custom amongst the
ancient Egyptians."</p>

<p>"Yes, by Gumdragon! it is," assented the leech,
"and it would be good for several of you if you profited
by the lesson, for I could mention some who have progressed
precious little since those times."</p>

<p>"Come, come, doctor," insisted Oldstone, "I've
seen you yourself take very kindly to your little glass of
punch at our convivial meetings." (Here the antiquary
winked furtively at some of the older members, as if he
had scored something.)</p>

<p>"No, sir; never to the extent of being carried to bed
helplessly drunk, as I have seen you, sir&mdash;not unfrequently,
I regret to say," replied the doctor, indignantly.</p>

<p>A general laugh from all the members of the club,
in which our antiquary heartily joined, was a signal for a
cessation of hostilities, and good humour was restored.</p>

<p>It may interest our readers, before we go further, to
learn some news of our artist since his departure. According
to his promise he had written, first from London and
later from Rome, to announce his safe arrival. He had
written many times since, and always to Mr. Oldstone.
His first letters had been short, and contained little more
than the bare news we have stated; desiring, at the same<span class='pagenum'>561</span>
time, to be remembered to all the inmates of the hostel,
including our landlord and his family.</p>

<p>These letters were promptly and voluminously replied
to by our antiquary, who, besides local news, of which
there was certainly a dearth, managed to fill up his
letters with wise saws and some fatherly advice,
delicately, not obtrusively given&mdash;such as is not unbecoming
from an elderly man towards one considerably
his junior. The tone of these letters seemed to call for
a reply something in the same spirit. It was impossible
for our artist to ignore the fact that the old man had
taken a prodigious liking to him&mdash;loved him, in fact, as
we have said, like a son. He could not reply curtly or
coldly to words that so evidently came from the good
man's heart, so he sat him down and penned equally
long epistles, relating his adventures, the people he had
met, and the places he had seen; thanking our antiquary at
the same time for the kindly interest he had always
taken in him.</p>

<p>It soon became apparent to our artist, from sundry
hints carefully worded by his antiquarian friend, that the
latter was no stranger to the secret he held within his
breast. He doubted not but that all the members of
the club knew it, and this thought caused him some
annoyance; but there was something in the veiled
sympathy of this fatherly old man, with his covert
innuendos, his tact and discretion, that touched him
deeply, and made it impossible not to open his heart to
him and pour forth the secrets of his soul.<span class='pagenum'>562</span></p>

<p>The ice was broken. Letters poured in thicker than
ever, and the other members, recognising always the
same handwriting, wondered what there could be so
much in common between a young man like McGuilp
and one of Mr. Oldstone's years. Moreover, they
noticed that the antiquary never vouchsafed to read
these letters aloud, merely certain portions here and
there, where it referred to themselves, and these were
short enough, while they watched their aged member as
he gloated over page after page of close writing with
evident satisfaction. There seemed a certain want of
confidence in this, which each secretly resented; but
they said nothing, merely venting their spleen among
themselves by alluding to our artist as "the old un's
prot&eacute;g&eacute;."</p>

<p>Now, about a year previous, Mr. Oldstone had
received some important news from his young friend in
Rome. He had lately completed a life-size half-length
portrait, in which he had made use of the study he had
taken of our landlord's daughter. The head he had
copied from this study, but he had added a figure,
which made it more interesting as a picture. The work
had been finished in Rome, and sent to England to be
exhibited at the Royal Academy, then held at Somerset
House. It had not only been accepted, but hung upon
the line, besides receiving high eulogiums from the
President, Sir Joshua Reynolds, who, on a private view
day, had been observed holding forth before a knot of
students and expatiating upon the merits of this <i>chef
d'&#339;uvre</i>.<span class='pagenum'>563</span></p>

<p>One of the students, a friend of our artist, had
written to him to congratulate him on his success, at
the same time enclosing him a slip from the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>,
being a critique in which his work was extolled to the
skies, and alluded to as <i>the</i> picture of the season, and
the painter as "a great genius who had taken the world
by storm, and had already reached the temple of fame."</p>

<p>This excerpt our artist in his turn enclosed to his
friend Oldstone, and wound up his letter by saying that
the picture had already been sold for a considerable
sum to Lord Landborough, a great patron of art, who
possessed a magnificent gallery at his country seat,
Feathernest, in Middleshire, filled with the choicest
specimens of ancient and modern art, in which company
our artist's picture, which he had chosen to
designate "The Landlord's Daughter," was destined to
find a place. In a postscript he referred to having just
read an account of a visit from their Majesties King
George III. and Queen Charlotte to Somerset House.
They had taken their eldest son, George, Prince of
Wales, with them to see the pictures. It is reported
that the young prince was so enamoured of the portrait
entitled "The Landlord's Daughter," that he cried when
they took him away, and said that he wanted her for his
nurse. His Majesty, ever indulgent towards his children,
suggested that to discover the original of the portrait
would not be impossible, in which case&mdash;&mdash;. But here
his royal spouse interposed, and with a vicious tap at
her snuff-box declared she would never allow such a face<span class='pagenum'>564</span>
in <i>her</i> household&mdash;not <i>she</i>. So the King of England
caved in.</p>

<p>Now, our antiquary affected no secrecy with regard
to this particular letter. There was no reason for it.
On the contrary, it treated of a public event which, in
all probability, the members of the club would read for
themselves in the papers, so calling our host and hostess
as well as their daughter together, he began thus in the
presence of all:</p>

<p>"You remember Mr. McGuilp, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Ay, sir, sure enough," responded our host. "I
hope he is very well."</p>

<p>"I believe so, Jack," said Oldstone. "Now listen
to this, all of you."</p>

<p>Here he read the letter aloud, from beginning to
end, adding, at its conclusion, on his own account,
"There, I knew my boy had it in him. I saw it from
the first, as soon as I set eyes on the portrait he
painted of our Helen."</p>

<p>"Never blush, girl!" ventured Mr. Parnassus, but
a stern look from Mr. Oldstone checked further banter.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well!" muttered our landlord. "To
think that <i>our</i> daughter should have her portrait
exhibited at the Royal Academy. That the Royal
family should see it, and, moreover, that it should have
been bought by a peer of the realm, and paid for
money down. Why! it passes belief. Don't it Molly?"
Our hostess thus appealed to by her spouse, admitted
that it <i>did</i> seem strange, and suggested that perhaps all<span class='pagenum'>565</span>
that got into the papers might not be true. The
suggestion was instantly howled down. Cries of "Yes,
yes, every word of it," from Mr. Crucible. "Especially
that part where the Queen wouldn't have such a face
about her at any price," chimed in Professor Cyanite.</p>

<p>"Just like the old cat, jealous of her husband,"
added Mr. Blackdeed.</p>

<p>"Exactly so," agreed Dr. Bleedem.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, gentlemen, a truce to this," now interrupted
Mr. Oldstone. "I propose that we meet together
this evening at eight o'clock, over a steaming bowl of
rum punch, such as our good host here understands so
well how to brew, and that we drink to the health of
our artist friend, with a three times three." This
proposition was unanimously applauded, and subsequently
carried out. We much fear that on this
occasion our worthy chairman was again carried away
rather too much by his&mdash;emotion.</p>

<p>The next morning our antiquary came down late for
breakfast, rather muddled in the upper regions, with,
moreover, several sharp twinges of gout, which reminded
him that he was not so young as he used to be. His
coffee had got cold, and he had been left to finish his
breakfast alone, all the other members having been
drawn away to their several avocations.</p>

<p>"Do you want anything, sir?" asked Helen,
appearing at the door.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, my girl," answered Oldstone. "I want
you to sit down here, and keep me company."<span class='pagenum'>566</span></p>

<p>"I can't stay for long, sir," replied Helen. "Mother
is sure to be calling me."</p>

<p>"No matter. Wait till she calls. Now, Helen, tell
me, what do you think of that letter I read out to you
yesterday&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>For answer Helen rubbed her hands together for
joy, and flushed all over her face. Then clasping her
hands upon her breast, and looking upwards, muttered
as if unconscious of anyone's presence, "I <i>knew</i>, I
knew he loved me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am afraid he does, you dangerous young
puss," observed Oldstone. "Too much so for his
peace of mind, poor boy!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but not more than <i>I</i> love <i>him</i>. <i>That</i>
were impossible."</p>

<p>"And you're not afraid of confessing as much to <i>me</i>,
you brazen hussy?" demanded the old man, playfully
chucking her under the chin.</p>

<p>"To <i>you</i>, you know I am not," replied the girl. "To
you, sir, I feel I could, nay, I <i>must</i>, tell everything, and
oh! it <i>is</i> such a comfort to have a real true friend from
whom one need hide nothing!"</p>

<p>"Well, well, my dear," said Oldstone, "I am sure I
have always wished to be your true friend, but whether
I am doing right in encouraging you in a passion which
cannot end wisely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It need never end," interrupted Helen. "I will
love him eternally, even if he should cease to love <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"You would!" exclaimed the antiquary with
surprise, looking at her curiously.<span class='pagenum'>567</span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I would. What of that?"</p>

<p>"But if he could not marry you," rejoined her
counsellor.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you that the thought of marriage
never entered my head," persisted the girl.</p>

<p>"You did, my child, but it won't do in this world,"
and the old man shook his head.</p>

<p>"What! can I not love the man of my choice&mdash;especially
if I know that he loves me? Who will
prevent me loving him, thinking of him, praying for
him, <i>dying</i> for him, if need be? Who shall tear his
image from my heart, through whatever trials I may
have to pass for <i>his</i> sake?"</p>

<p>"Helen, you are a noble girl?" cried our antiquary
with enthusiasm. I have no more arguments to use. I
wish there were a few more like you in the world. But
hark ye, my child, there are others who have felt like
yourself for a time&mdash;but how long has it lasted?</p>

<p>"The greater part of your sex, I fear, find it easy to
overthrow an old love for a new one. Then follow
other new ones in succession, till they end perhaps in
marrying someone they don't love, and can't love; all
for wealth, title, or position."</p>

<p>"You surely don't think <i>I</i> could be so base, Mr.
Oldstone," cried the girl, recoiling in horror.</p>

<p>"No, my dear. That is the very last thing I should
believe of <i>you</i>," replied her friend.</p>

<p>"I am glad of that," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Helen!" cried the voice of Dame Hearty, outside;<span class='pagenum'>568</span>
"Where are you?" "Here, mother," answered her
daughter. "I was only having a word with Mr.
Oldstone," and she hurried away, leaving the antiquary
alone with his writing materials.</p>

<p>The breakfast having been cleared away, Oldstone
drew his chair up to the table and proceeded to pen a
reply to his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;. When the letter was
concluded, our antiquary reperused it, carefully dotting
each <i>i</i> and crossing each <i>t</i>, until he found no more to
correct.</p>

<p>If our reader is not more scrupulous than we are
ourselves, he will join us, in imagination, in an act not
generally considered respectable&mdash;viz., that of playing
the spy on the old man, by peering over his shoulder,
and reading what he has written, before he folds it up,
seals it, and sends it to the post.</p>

<div class="bblockquot">

<p class="center"><i>Letter from Mr. Oldstone to Mr. Vandyke McGuilp.</i></p>
<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Boy</span>,</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; "I cannot express to you the joy and pride I
felt in perusing your last letter, and I hasten to offer you
my best congratulations, and I think I may add those
of the rest of our members, on having achieved what I
must needs call such unprecedented success. I read
your letter, together with the critique from the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> enclosed, aloud, before the whole club, our
worthy host and his family being also present. You
should have seen the blush that suffused our dear
Helen's cheek at the mention of the success of her<span class='pagenum'>569</span>
portrait. It was as if she had said, 'Lo, he has become
great, and all through <i>me</i>. <i>My</i> face it was that
inspired him to achieve such fame. <i>My</i> prayers and
good wishes that buoyed him up with energy to thus
distinguish himself!' Some such thoughts must have
passed through her mind, if I am any reader of faces&mdash;and
I think I am.</p>

<p>"One of the younger members seemed disposed to
offer some banter, but I frowned him down. I never
will sanction any unseemly levity towards that girl, or
allow her to be treated as if she were a mere hackneyed
barmaid, used to the coarse jokes of any Tom, Dick or
Harry. To me she is something very precious, and I
love her as my own child. Poor little one! She
always comes to me for sympathy in her troubles. Not
even to her own parents will she confide everything&mdash;much
less to the other members. If you were to see
the change that has come over her of late! She has
lost all that raw awkwardness so common to growing
girls, and has now developed into mature womanhood.</p>

<p>"Since your departure, young man, I could not but
pity the poor child with her sunken cheek, her downcast
eyes, and listless manner. I knew she had a secret
that weighed upon her, and I guessed what it was. I
came forward to offer her my friendship and advice,
and encouraged her to open her heart to me. The
poor child's gratitude was so touching! There <i>must</i> be
an outburst when the heart is full, and she could
confide in no one else.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>570</span>"Ever
since she found she had a true friend to lean
on, I have noticed a marked change in the girl. The
rose returned to her cheek, the light to her eye, an
expression came into her face that I never observed
before&mdash;nay, a variety of expressions which seem to
chase each other with marvellous rapidity over a
countenance lovely, intelligent, and pure.</p>

<p>"Dr. Bleedem, poor man! seeing her looking mopish,
prescribed her a course of steel medicine. She declares
that he only gave her one dose, which he made her
take in his presence. The rest of the medicine he left
her to take by herself. Now the girl insists positively
that, not liking the medicine, she threw it all away.</p>

<p>"Dr. Bleedem, of course, is under the impression
that she took it all, and naturally attributes her sudden
change of health for the better to his drugs. I am of
opinion that it was medicine of another sort that
brought back the roses to her cheek. She is now
eighteen, and by our peasantry would be considered of
a marriageable age; but oh! I <i>do</i> begrudge her to any
of these country bumpkins, who come in for their mug
of ale and their chaff. There is no one for miles round
anything like good enough for her. Of one thing,
however, I feel quite certain, and that is, that she would
never allow herself to be coaxed, cajoled, or threatened
into marrying any man whom she did not love, however
advantageous the match might appear in the eyes of the
world. No, the girl has character, and would never
give her hand where she had not set her affections.<span class='pagenum'>571</span>
She would far sooner not marry at all. Whoever
should win her affections will be a lucky man, for he
will get a treasure in such a wife.</p>

<p>"Excuse the wanderings of an old dotard, my friend,
but when I once get upon this topic, I am inexhaustible;
and as for local news, there simply is none. When last
I spoke to Helen about writing to you, she desired me
to send her duty to you. Pretty soul! <i>duty</i> indeed.
Now, my dear boy, I must really draw this epistle to a
close. Trusting that you are enjoying the best of health
and spirits, and wishing you continued and ever
increasing success in your art.</p>

<p style='text-align: right'>

"Your doting but affectionate old friend,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Obadiah Oldstone</span>." &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
</p>
</div>

<p>We have said that Mr. Oldstone was prompt in
answering the letters of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Neither was our
artist, as a rule, tardy in answering those of his aged
friend. Seldom more than a month passed between a
letter and its answer, on either side. Yet to this letter
no reply came. Month followed month, and no
tidings arrived of our artist. Such delay was most
unusual, and Mr. Oldstone now began to be seriously
alarmed. What had happened to the boy? Was he
ill? He knew by experience that the summer months
in Rome were extremely unhealthy, on account of
the malaria. Was he laid up with Roman fever? Had
he met with an accident? Or was there anything in<span class='pagenum'>572</span>
the tone of his letter that had given offence? He tried
to recollect. No, he thought not; in fact, he did not
know what to think. The gloomiest fancies rushed
across his mind as he paced the breakfast room alone.</p>

<p>Presently his eye caught the portrait of Helen, that
McGuilp had presented to the club, and which he,
Oldstone, had with his own hands hung up over the
mantel. "Ah! my pretty puss," said he, addressing
the painted canvas smiling down at him, "I dare not
infect you with my fears. I don't want to make <i>you</i>
unhappy."</p>

<p>Just then the door gaped ajar, and the original of
the portrait appeared at the opening. As the antiquary
had not yet noticed her, his eyes being still fixed on the
portrait, Helen stepped into the room and closed the
door behind her. Then, walking straight up to Oldstone,
she said, "Please sir, has anything happened?"</p>

<p>"Happened, my dear! What should happen in this
dead-and-alive place? Nothing ever happens here."</p>

<p>"Ah! sir," rejoined Helen, "you but evade my
question. You know what I would ask."</p>

<p>"My dear, how should I?" demanded her friend
and counsellor, with most provoking <i>sang froid</i>.</p>

<p>A gesture of impatience escaped the girl. Then
fixing her eyes steadily on those of the antiquary, as if
to read his inmost soul, she said with some approach to
severity in her tone, "Mr. Oldstone, you are keeping
something from me. Something has happened to Mr.
McGuilp, and you won't tell me what it is."<span class='pagenum'>573</span></p>

<p>"On my honour, my sweet child," replied her
friend, "I know no more than you do yourself. I wish
I did. Here have I been waiting now about six months
for a reply to my letter, when he used often to write by
return of post. I can't make head or tail of it."</p>

<p>"Then something <i>is</i> wrong, you may depend upon
it," cried the girl. "Oh, dear! oh, dear! Surely he is
laid up with some dreadful illness&mdash;away from me, and
in a strange country, with no one to attend upon him.
Oh, merciful Heaven! help him! Oh, help him. Whatever
it is, let me know the worst!"</p>

<p>"I don't want to frighten you, my pet," broke in
Oldstone; "but I own I am much perplexed myself.
Perhaps he never received the letter. Sometimes letters
get lost. At any rate, we'll hope for the best."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, sir!" cried the girl in agony, "do you
think that likely?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear. Why not? All sorts of things
happen to prevent letters arriving&mdash;especially those sent
abroad. Vessels go down at sea; the mail may be
detained by an accident. Who can tell? Come, cheer
up, girl; there is no good in brooding. If I don't hear
from him in another week I'll write again."</p>

<p>"Why not write at once, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not a bad idea, Helen; so I will."</p>

<p>At this juncture voices and footsteps were heard outside.
The other members of the club had just returned
in time for their mid-day meal. So the letter was postponed.<span class='pagenum'>574</span></p>

<p>Helen ran to lay the cloth, and the repast was served.
The meal being over, pipes were lit, and some desultory
conversation ensued, interspersed with wonderments
about our artist's long silence and suggestions as to the
reason of it. The weather still being fine, the members
suggested a stroll, so off they went together, Mr. Oldstone
being also of the party. Thus, what with one
interruption and what with another, the writing of the
letter was put off for that day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p>Next morning, in the middle of breakfast, a knock
was heard at the door, and our landlord let himself in
with the newspaper in his hand and an expression like
a sphinx on his face. He closed the door quietly after
him, and walking up to Mr. Oldstone presented him
with the paper, at the same time silently pointing out to
him a paragraph that he had already marked with his
thumb-nail. The door was no sooner closed than it
silently re-opened, apparently by itself, and remained
some three or four inches ajar. Few noticed this, or
would have given it a thought if they had. Their
attention was rivetted on Mr. Oldstone, as he settled his
spectacles on his nose preparatory to reading out some
tit-bit of news.</p>

<p>"Eh! What!" exclaimed the antiquary, trembling,
and turning pale with extreme emotion. "Just listen to
this, gentlemen, all of you:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bblockquot">
<p class="center">
"'<span class="smcap">Captured by the Brigands.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"'The well-known artist, Mr. Vandyke McGuilp,
whose picture of "The Landlord's Daughter" caused
such a <i>furore</i> last exhibition at the Royal Academy,
whilst taking a trip in the Sabine Mountains, in the<span class='pagenum'>576</span>
vicinity of Rome, to recuperate his health, was suddenly
surrounded by a band of brigands, about twelve in
number, who sprang upon him from an ambush and
compelled him to surrender. The painter was alone
and unarmed, besides being hampered by the materials
of his art. All resistance would have been worse than
useless, so, finding himself perfectly defenceless, he had
no choice but to "stand and deliver." They seized his
gold watch and other trinkets, as well as all the coin
that he carried about him. Not satisfied with this, they
forced him to tramp with them high up in the fastnesses
of the mountains, where he still remains in daily and
hourly peril of his life. The brigand chief has demanded
an exorbitant ransom, and threatens that if it does not
arrive within five days they will cut off his ears and send
them to his friends in a letter. Any attempt at rescue,
they declare, will at once seal the fate of their captive.
His position is one to cause the greatest anxiety to his
friends, as the barbarity of these desperadoes is well
known.'"</p></div>

<p>Our antiquary had proceeded thus far when all
present were startled by a smothered shriek, which was
followed by a dull thud, as from a heavy fall. All rushed
to the door, and flung it open. Helen had fainted.</p>

<p>Need we relate with what agility Dr. Bleedem leapt
to the fore; how carefully he raised the slim form in his
arms, cut her stay lace, and applied restoratives; then,
finally, with the assistance of our host, carried his
patient upstairs, where he deposited her on her own<span class='pagenum'>577</span>
little bed, administering in every way to her comfort&mdash;this
we will leave to the imagination of the reader&mdash;whilst,
in the breakfast-room below, the various members
talked to each other in subdued tones, and Mr.
Oldstone looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Humph! I think I can see through the spoke of
<i>that</i> wheel," muttered Mr. Hardcase to his neighbour.</p>

<p>"Yes, a dreadful blow though, poor girl!" sighed
Mr. Parnassus.</p>

<p>"Quite dramatic in its effect," remarked Mr.
Blackdeed.</p>

<p>A snort came from Mr. Oldstone, who had turned
his back on the group and begun reperusing the
newspaper that he had thrust into his capacious pocket,
when Dr. Bleedem re-entered the room.</p>

<p>"Well, doctor," inquired Professor Cyanite, "and
what of your patient?"</p>

<p>"Recovered now, of course, but dreadfully shaken,"
replied our medico. "The nervous system has sustained
a terrible shock. Luckily, she has suffered no injuries
from her fall."</p>

<p>"Poor young thing!" observed Mr. Crucible,
compassionately.  "Well, who can wonder at it?"</p>

<p>During these remarks, to which Mr. Oldstone paid
no attention whatever, being absorbed in the reperusal
of his newspaper, he was suddenly observed to flush as
with pleasure. His brow cleared, his eye sparkled.
Then, suddenly rising from his chair, he crumpled
up his paper, thrust it again into his pocket, rubbed his<span class='pagenum'>578</span>
hands with satisfaction, then with a relieved expression
in his face he slowly left the room without a word.</p>

<p>"Wonder what's come over Oldstone!" muttered
one of them. "He seems quite himself again."</p>

<p>No sooner was our antiquary outside the door than
he beckoned the landlord aside, who was still looking
grave, and asked him how he had left his daughter.</p>

<p>"Dreadful cut up like, sir, 'bout somethin' or other,"
replied that worthy, "but Dr. Bleedem says as how we
ain't got no call to be afeared, and that when she has
finished the cordial she'll come round agin as right as
a trivet."</p>

<p>"Now look here, Jack," began our antiquary,
rubbing his hands together cheerily, and with difficulty
repressing his delight. "What'll you bet that in five
minutes time I don't bring her round again, cordial or
no cordial?"</p>

<p>"Do you think you could, sir?" asked our host,
somewhat incredulously, yet becoming infected, in spite
of himself, by Mr. Oldstone's assurance and good humour.</p>

<p>"I do, mine host, most certainly I do," replied the
antiquary.</p>

<p>"Can I see the patient?"</p>

<p>"Willingly, sir," rejoined the landlord. "There is
her room," and pointed to the door.</p>

<p>"Now, Jack, you shall see which is the best doctor,
Bleedem or I. If in five minutes I don't lead her out
by the hand, smiling and in her right mind, my name's
not Obadiah Oldstone."<span class='pagenum'>579</span></p>

<p>Here, he opened Helen's chamber door, and for the
space of five minutes was closeted with her, leaving our
host completely bewildered. The girl started at seeing
her friend and adviser enter her chamber, and looked at
him inquiringly. "Helen, my pet," he began, "I am
the bearer of good news&mdash;news that will do you more
good than any cordial Dr. Bleedem can give you."</p>

<p>The girl looked hopeful, seeing her counsellor's
cheerful manner, though her eyes were still red and
swollen with weeping. "Tell me, tell me!" she cried
in agony.</p>

<p>"Patience, patience," replied the antiquary, in the
most provoking manner; "all in due time. Well, my
dear," he continued, "all that I read out in the paper
this morning, and which you unfortunately overheard
(Oh! you wicked puss, for playing the eavesdropper);
well, child, all that happened a fortnight ago. Since
then there is later news. The boy has been rescued
by a band of carabineers who have long been on the
track of the brigands, who were taken completely by
surprise. A skirmish took place, and the brigands
were exterminated to a man; a few only of the
carabineers being wounded. Your friend, Mr. Vandyke
McGuilp, was at once set at liberty, and he is now
enjoying the best of health and spirits. So cheer up,
girl."</p>

<p>"Oh! sir," cried Helen, half laughing and half
crying, "you are not trying to comfort me by&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"By a false report," broke in Oldstone. "Certainly<span class='pagenum'>580</span>
not, child. Here, read for yourself. Can't you believe
me?"</p>

<p>Helen took up the paper with trembling hands, and
ran her eyes eagerly over the column. Then with a
sweet smile and sign of relief she sank back on her
cushions, crying, "Thank God." She then burst out
again into a fresh fit of weeping, from sheer weakness,
which, however, soon changed into a laugh. Then
rousing herself, she leapt from her bed, bathed her face
with cold water, and having dried it, she seized the hand
of her aged friend and counsellor and kissed it, saying,
"God bless you, sir. You were ever my good angel."</p>

<p>"Then follow me downstairs, and look as beaming
as you can. Your parents will wonder at the change, but
I shall say nothing." Seizing her hand, Oldstone led
her down the flight of steps, at the foot of which stood
her father, watch in hand.</p>

<p>"There, Jack," said the antiquary in triumph,
"What did I say? Have I been successful? Look at
her, and tell me if I am a good doctor or no."</p>

<p>Our host scanned his daughter's now happy features,
then turning to Mr. Oldstone, he said, "Well, sir, its
just wonderful! It's like witchcraft a'most. I don't
know what you have been doing to her, sir, but I never
see such a change in my life."</p>

<p>Here Dame Hearty made her appearance, caressed
her daughter, and began to ask questions.</p>

<p>"Now, no questions, Dame Hearty, from either you
or your husband," broke in Oldstone. "That's our secret.<span class='pagenum'>581</span>
You may, if you like, set it down to Dr. Bleedem's
cordial."</p>

<p>"Well, we won't bother her, if as how you don't
wish it, sir," answered her father. Helen then followed
her mother into the kitchen, and was soon slaving
away harder than she had ever done before in her life.</p>

<p>"Well, boys," said Mr. Oldstone, cheerily, addressing
his fellow-members as they looked enquiringly at
him on his return, "I suppose you want to know the
reason of the change in my countenance since the
morning. Well, take this paper and read for yourselves.
You will see where I have marked it." Here he handed
the paper to Mr. Hardcase, who, taking it from him,
proceeded to read the account of our artist's fortunate
rescue from the brigands by the carabineers, which we
need not repeat.</p>

<p>"Ah!" observed the lawyer, at the conclusion,
"this accounts for everything. Now, Oldstone, if you
had read this article first, and the other afterwards, we
should have been spared a scene."</p>

<p>Oldstone answered with something like a snort,
"Bah! who could tell that the girl was eavesdropping?"
Then noticing the quizzical expression on the faces of
some of the members, and guessing that they were
about to make Helen's little love episode a subject for
discussion or banter, he raised his hand as if in prohibition,
being determined to nip it in the bud, and
bringing it down with a bang on the table, he began,
"Gentlemen, to change the conversation, I propose<span class='pagenum'>582</span>
that we celebrate our young friend McGuilp's miraculous
escape from his captors by assembling this evening
round a merry bowl of punch&mdash;eh, doctor?&mdash;and drinking
his health with a three times three."</p>

<p>"Take care, Oldstone!" remonstrated Dr. Bleedem;
but the rest of the members applauded the proposition
of the chairman, and prevailed. In fact, a merry evening
was spent, when our artist's health was drunk, as
proposed, as well as that of all his family and belongings.
Our host was then called in, and had to drain a
glass to the health and prosperity of our artist. Dame
Hearty was next called in, and had to do the same. One
of the members voted for Helen also drinking the toast.</p>

<p>Before Oldstone could offer any opposition, our
landlord called out, "Now, then, Helen, my girl, come
and drink to the health and prosperity of Mr. McGuilp,
your portrait painter, with a hip, hip, hip, hurrah!&mdash;d'ye
hear? Come, now, you can't get out of it."</p>

<p>The girl would willingly have hidden herself, and
had literally to be dragged in by her father, blushing
and timid. Loud cheers greeted the girl's appearance,
and a glass was filled for her from the punch-bowl by
Mr. Oldstone himself with the silver ladle, at the bottom
of which a golden guinea had been inlaid.</p>

<p>"All right, my girl," said Mr. Oldstone, "toss it off.
No harm in just one glass. Now, then, all&mdash;to the
health of our absent artist friend, Mr. Vandyke
McGuilp, and all his belongings&mdash;also to his speedy
return&mdash;with a hip, hip, hip, hurrah!"<span class='pagenum'>583</span></p>

<p>With a charming modesty and grace, like that of a
high-born lady, did this simple country girl join in the
toast proposed; then, putting down her glass on the
table, she curtseyed elegantly to the company, and
wishing them all good-night retired.</p>

<p>Loud applause followed this flying visit of Helen to
their orgie, and they would have recalled her; but a
glance from Mr. Oldstone kept them in check. At
midnight the party broke up, and each returned to his
bed comfortable, without having indulged to excess,
and even Mr. Oldstone walked bravely off to his bed
unassisted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p>A week had passed since our last chapter. Our
antiquary, finding himself once more alone, had brought
out his writing materials, determined no longer to put off
his much-delayed letter to his friend, when a smart tap
at the door, and immediately afterwards the entry of our
host's pretty daughter, caused him to look up. She
appeared more radiant than ever, and held up a bulky
epistle with a foreign post mark. Full well she knew
the handwriting. It was addressed to Mr. Oldstone, as
usual, so she placed it in his hands.</p>

<p>"At last!" exclaimed the antiquary. "Now we
shall see for ourselves. Sit down, my girl, sit down."</p>

<p>The invitation had been hardly given when the
daughter of our host had already seated herself, and
leaning her elbow on the table and her head in her
hand, looked all attention.</p>

<p>Oldstone broke the seal, put on his spectacles, and
thus began:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bblockquot">
<p class="center"><i>Letter from Mr. Vandyke McGuilp to Mr. Oldstone.</i></p>

<p style='text-align: right'>"Rome, Oct. &mdash;, 17&mdash;. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>"<span class="smcap">My Esteemed Friend</span>,</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; "I offer you my most humble apologies for my<span class='pagenum'>585</span>
delay in answering your interesting and most welcome
letter, which, in fact, I have only just received. You
will see by what follows that there were some extenuating
circumstances, which may go far towards exculpating
my apparent neglect. Your letter arrived at the
'Caf&eacute; Greco,' where I usually have my letters directed,
the day after my departure from Rome. They could
not forward it, not knowing my whereabouts, so I did
not get it until after my return.</p>

<p>"I must now go back some months to explain to
you how, from over anxiety about finishing a picture, I
had put off my trip for the summer so late as to be about
the last man left in Rome; for all those who can abandon
the Eternal City before the great heat comes on. At
the time I speak of I actually believe there were more
statues in Rome than living men. The models even
had all returned to their respective villages, and the steps
of the Spanish Staircase in the Piazza di Spagna were
deserted. You may remember, sir, how even in your
day they congregated in groups on this broad and
elegant flight of steps, waiting for custom, lighting up
the scene with their bright costumes. Well, the heat
grew at length unbearable, till, what with over-work and
the climate, I found myself prostrate with Roman fever.
I was necessarily confined to my bed, and it was with
difficulty that I could find a doctor. At last they sent
me a Capuchin friar, who professed to have some knowledge
of medical science&mdash;very limited, I should imagine,
though perhaps enough for my purpose. He prescribed<span class='pagenum'>586</span>
me medicine, and sent to attend upon me the cobbler's
wife, who lives on the ground floor, and who makes my
bed and sweeps out my room for me. The poor old
woman has a sick husband, and looks far from healthy
herself. She is yellow, almost toothless, with a strong
beard, very far from clean&mdash;and oh! her breath! There,
I will say no more. The poor old thing did her best, no
doubt, and I don't want to be ungrateful. I couldn't
help wishing, I remember, that instead of being laid up
here I could have been laid up in England&mdash;somewhere
in the country&mdash;say at the 'Headless Lady,' and had the
pretty Helen to wait upon me. It would be worth
while getting ill then."</p></div>

<p>"Stay," broke in Helen; "does he say that? Let
me see. You are not joking with me, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear," answered Oldstone, "I am not
joking. You may see for yourself; but I don't know if
I ought to read you all this nonsense. Won't it content
you just to know that he is alive and well?"</p>

<p>Without heeding her friend and counsellor, Helen
rubbed her hands together with glee, and laughed, saying,
"Oh! I <i>do</i> wish he would come and be ill in our
house&mdash;oh! no, I don't mean that, do I? I mean
that he would come and live here altogether, without
being ill, and that I could be with him always, all day
long, and never leave him."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear," replied Oldstone; "I know what
you mean. You would like&mdash;there, never mind. The
thing can't be, so what is the use of thinking about him?"<span class='pagenum'>587</span></p>

<p>"Why not, if it makes me happy?" was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>"There, there, I can never argue with a woman,"
muttered Oldstone. "I've a good mind not to read
you any more of his nonsense."</p>

<p>"Mr. Oldstone," cried Helen, "you know you
couldn't be so cruel."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," asked her friend, "what more do
you want to know? I can't wade knee-deep through
all this. There isn't time. Your mother will be calling
you soon."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, please. Just a little more before
mother calls. Then I'll go at once," pleaded Helen,
coaxingly.</p>

<p>The antiquary was as wax in her hands. "Well,
then, he goes on to say:"</p>

<div class="bblockquot">
<p>"As soon as I was fairly recovered, I thought I
would delay my holiday no longer, and accordingly took
the diligence, only too glad to leave the infected city
behind me, and to breathe a little fresh mountain air.
What a complete change of climate I experienced high
up in these mountain regions! And, oh! I cannot
describe to you the extreme beauty and wildness of the
scenery; the quaintness of some of these mountain
villages, and the primitive state of their inhabitants!
I had not been long in one of these out-of-the-way
places when one morning I was tramping along in search
of the picturesque, laden with my painting materials,
when from behind some rocky crags some dozen
brigands surrounded me.<span class='pagenum'>588</span></p>

<p>"'<i>Faccia in terra</i>' (face on the ground), cried the
brigand chief and the rest of the band in chorus, as
they levelled their carbines at me.</p>

<p>"I was alone and unarmed, so had no choice but to
do as I was commanded, so I prostrated myself, face to
the ground. Several brigands came forward to search
me, robbed me of my gold watch and all my loose cash.
Then they opened my pocket-book, where, besides finding
paper money, they came upon my passport. This
they handed to their chief.</p>

<p>"'So,' said he, after perusing it; 'so it seems you
are an Englishman. Good. The English are rich.
You must put up with our company until your friends
can disburse the sum of ten thousand pounds sterling.'</p>

<p>"In vain I tried to explain to him that I was only a
poor artist, who earned his living by the sweat of his
brow. I saw I was not believed.</p>

<p>"'But you have rich friends,' he persisted. 'I know
it by your face; so you don't fool me.'</p>

<p>"He then made a sign for me to follow them, so I
had to tramp higher and higher up into the mountains,
till I was ready to drop, while these well trained
mountaineers leapt from crag to crag with the agility
of a chamois, till they reached a cave, where they halted."</p>
</div>

<p>"There, Helen, run along," said Mr. Oldstone, as he
had got thus far. "There's your mother calling you."</p>

<p>Off rushed Helen to her mother, who was waiting
for her at the door of the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Come, girl," cried Dame Hearty, "I can't think<span class='pagenum'>589</span>
what you find to talk about with Mr. Oldstone every
day. You are quite losing your head. Now, set to
work, for we are terribly behind-hand."</p>

<p>The door once closed upon Helen, our antiquary
read his friend's letter slowly through to the end. It
gave an elaborate account of our artist's experience with
the brigands, which we need not relate. Stay!&mdash;here
was something at the end of the letter, marked "Private,"
that promised to be interesting. What could it be?</p>

<div class="bblockquot"><p>"(<i>Private.</i>)&mdash;I must now touch upon a subject
which causes me the greatest anxiety. A report has
reached me through an artist friend, who was staying on
a visit to Lord Landborough, who, you will remember,
bought my picture entitled 'The Landlord's Daughter.'
Amongst other visitors at his country seat who were there
at the time was one Lord Scampford, a young sprig of
nobility, rich, accomplished, but of infamous character;
a gamester, and a profligate of the first water, who had
become so enamoured of my portrait of Helen, then
hanging on the walls of the Academy, that in his cups
he swore, by Gumdragon, that he would search the
world over to find out the original, and that, willy-nilly,
he would make her his paramour. Likewise, he would
shoot any man dead who dared to stand in his way.
Turning to my friend, he asked him if he knew the
painter of the work: and upon his answering in the
affirmative, he next asked him if he knew the model who
had sat for the picture. This my friend was unable to
tell him, as he was ignorant himself who it was. He<span class='pagenum'>590</span>
then asked for my address, and being informed I lived
in Rome, he at once set out for Italy, and, in fact,
arrived here, and called upon me at my studio, but was
denied admittance, as I was then laid up with the fever.
After I had recovered, I heard that he had been the
round of all the studios, and that of every artist he had
been asking if, perchance, they could tell him where I had
got my model from. Not one of them knew. Shortly
after his arrival I heard that he had received a letter
which necessitated his immediate return to England.</p>

<p>"This letter, it seems, was from his valet, a big
powerful man, who generally accompanied him as his
bully, and who aids him in his nefarious schemes. This
man he had left behind him in England, with orders to
scour the country for miles round about London, and
to inform himself at every wayside inn, if the original
of the picture on the Academy walls lived there. For a
long time his search was fruitless. At last chance
came to his aid. On one of his visits to the Royal
Academy, just to refresh his memory of the features in
the picture, he overheard a broadbacked old farmer, just
up from the country, say to his wife,</p>

<p>"'Why, dash my wig, Sally, if here ain't the face of
dear little Helen Hearty, daughter of my old friend, Jack
Hearty, as keeps the 'Headless Lady,' at the cross-roads.'</p>

<p>"Upon hearing this, the valet stepped forward. 'Do
I understand you to say that you know the original of
this portrait?' he asked.</p>

<p>"'Know her!' exclaimed the farmer, 'Ay, marry<span class='pagenum'>591</span>
do I. Why she is my God-daughter? I've danced her
on my knee since she were a kid, bless her heart! And
now I remember, I did hear as how one o' them paintin'
fellers&mdash;limners, they call 'em, was a puttin' up at the
'Headless Lady,' and a paintin' 'er likeness. Well,
now, I never!&mdash;eh Sally?'</p>

<p>"'Dear me!' remarked the valet, 'How <i>very</i>
strange! Really, this is <i>most</i> interesting. Tell me, good
man, what part of the country is this you speak of?'</p>

<p>"'What! the hostel of the 'Headless Lady'?
Why, at the cross-roads-parish of Littleboro', near
Muddleton, on Slush Slopshire.'</p>

<p>"'Ah, in that part, I see. Fine country they tell
me, about there. Bracing air, good shooting&mdash;eh?'
inquired the valet, as he opened his pocket-book and
jotted down all the farmer told him.</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir, good air, good shooting, and as fine a
bit of country, though I ses it, as shouldn't, seeing as
how its my birthplace.'</p>

<p>"Here, the valet took out his watch, and exclaimed,
'God bless my soul! How time flies! Why, it's just
upon one o'clock, and I had an appointment at twelve,
on urgent business. Good-day, my friend. Good-day,
Ma'am,' addressing himself to the farmer's wife, and off
he goes.</p>

<p>"'A pleasant, affable gentleman,' remarked the
countryman to the wife of his bosom.</p>

<p>"'Ah, just ain't un,' acquiesced his spouse.</p>

<p>"That very day the valet penned a note to his lord
<span class='pagenum'>592</span>
and master, who returned to England in a great hurry
at the news. You may imagine, my friend, what anxiety
I feel, knowing that villain to be at large, and ready at
any time to swoop down like a vulture into your peaceful
dovecot and carry on his work of destruction, whilst I,
being so far away, am unable to strike a blow in her
defence. Though, God knows, I would willingly lay
down my life, rather than that dear child should come
to any harm. I write at once, having only just heard
the news. God grant I may be in time for my warning
to be of some avail. For all I know, the villain may be
there before this letter arrives. I tremble at the
thought. He is sure to travel in his own private coach,
accompanied by his bully, and, doubtless, both of them
will be armed to the teeth. You had better warn Jack
Hearty at once, in order that he may put his daughter
out of harm's way, until he has taken his departure.
His lordship will stick at nothing&mdash;even at drugging
her, and carrying her off insensible, and being armed, it
will be dangerous work to oppose him. I would advise
Jack Hearty, as soon as he can find an opportunity to
extract the bullets from his horse pistols, for depend
upon it he means mischief. This is all the advice I
can give him. Do whatever you can to frustrate the
plot of this villian, and write me the result. No time
for more. With kind remembrances to all your friends,
as well as to our worthy host and family,</p>

<p style='text-align: right'>
"Your anxious friend, &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
"<span class="smcap">Vandyke McGuilp</span>." &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
</p>
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'>593</span></p>

<p>"Dear! dear! dear!" muttered Oldstone to himself.
"This is terrible news indeed. I must seek Jack Hearty
at once, and inform him." Then, thrusting the letter
into his pocket, and with a troubled expression on his
face, he left the room, and beckoning to the landlord,
whom he found outside, he took him by the arm and
walked with him some considerable distance down one
of the cross-roads, and read to him the latter part of our
artist's letter. The landlord looked grave and stern.</p>

<p>"Humph," he grunted at length, "and this is all
through me allowin' my daughter's portrait to be
exhibited at the Royal Academy. If I had only
known!"</p>

<p>"Look here, Jack," said Oldstone. "This is a
thing that no one could foresee. Let us now think of
the remedy."</p>

<p>"What remedy?" asked Jack, gloomily. "Can I
refuse to take a traveller in&mdash;a nobleman, too, with a
handle to his name?"</p>

<p>"It is a desperate case, and we must be on the
alert," observed Oldstone. "I would suggest that we
take Dr. Bleedem into our confidence."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he may be able to administer to them
both a sleeping draught on going to bed, and whilst
they are both sound asleep, you can enter their rooms
and extract the bullets from their pistols, so that if perchance
they should attempt to use them against us, we
shall have nothing to fear on that score."<span class='pagenum'>594</span></p>

<p>"The very thing!" exclaimed our host. "Let us
seek the doctor at once."</p>

<p>This was done. At first the man of medicine
hummed and hawed, put on a look of importance, and
talked of his reputation, etc., but at length allowed himself
to be over-ruled, seeing the extreme urgency of the
case, and consented to give the landlord a little harmless
sleeping dose, which he could mix with their wine
or whatever they called for.</p>

<p>Dr. Bleedem now went inside, presumably to concoct
the charm by which occult power the evil designs
of their enemies were to be frustrated, leaving our host
and the antiquary discoursing together outside in low
tones. As these two individuals were gazing towards
the horizon, a small cloud of dust was presently discernible.</p>

<p>"Seems to be coming this way," said our host, after
a pause. "Wonder if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, just so," broke in Oldstone. "Shouldn't
wonder if it <i>were</i> our expected guest. He won't make
any unnecessary delay, I warrant."</p>

<p>"Sure enough it's a carriage and pair with a liveried
coachman and footman," observed the landlord. "How
they tear along! Oh, it's his lordship, without doubt.
I must go and warn my daughter."</p>

<p>Our host was somewhat tardy in arriving at this
decision, for a stately carriage emblazoned with an
escutcheon with innumerable quarterings, and surmounted
by a coronet, had now driven up to the door<span class='pagenum'>595</span>
of the inn, and both Dame Hearty and Helen were on
the doorstep to welcome the new arrivals.</p>

<p>A gorgeous footman descended to open the carriage
door, and out stepped a young man of middle height,
slim and somewhat graceful of figure, dressed in the
very height of fashion. Behind him stepped a powerfully-built
man, respectably dressed in black, with a
plebeian and repulsive countenance.</p>

<p>Our landlord came forward and saluted both guests
gravely.</p>

<p>"We want two bedrooms and a sitting-room, landlord,
and should like to dine in an hour," said Lord
Scampford; for it was none other. Then putting up
his spy-glass, he gazed at Helen from head to foot in
an impertinent manner, and the two men exchanged a
look of intelligence. The coachman and footman likewise
followed their lord's gaze, and smiled approvingly.</p>

<p>Our antiquary was making his observations in the
background whilst Jack Hearty was busying himself
with the luggage. As our host passed his daughter in
the passage he found time to say, <i>sotto voce</i>, "Helen,
my girl, shut yourself up in your room till I call you.
I want to speak to you."</p>

<p>Now it was not often that her father spoke to her in
so serious a tone, and these words, coupled with the
impression she had already formed of Lord Scampford
and his companion, which was not a favourable one,
caused her to tremble and turn pale. She knew there
was much in the world that she could not understand,<span class='pagenum'>596</span>
and it seemed to be considered wise not to make
enquiries. She asked no question therefore, but shut
herself up within her room as desired. No sooner was
the landlord able to break away from his new customers,
than he ascended to his daughter's chamber and
knocked at the door. Helen unlocked it, and her
father entered.</p>

<p>"My daughter," he said, "I wish you to keep as
much to yourself as possible during the stay of these
gentlemen below. I have my reasons. I know more than
you do, so do not ask why. Enough that it is my wish."</p>

<p>In the good old times, parents' commands were not
disputed, but humbly and reverently obeyed. So Helen,
with downcast eyes and hands crossed upon her breast,
answered respectfully, "It is well, sir."</p>

<p>"If, by any chance, they should cross your path
while you are engaged in your household duties," continued
her father, "and should address you, let your
answers be short, though civil. Remain not long
in their presence, but speedily withdraw. Moreover,
if they should be sitting over their wine and should
invite you to drink, to pledge them in a toast, drink not.
No, not even a <i>sip</i> to please them. My daughter, there
is danger ahead, and I warn you beforehand. You are
young and unversed in the wickedness of the world,
but obey me to the letter and you are safe. Heed not
their advances or their flattery, but shun them as a pest."</p>

<p>Having thus delivered himself, our worthy host
turned on his heel and left the chamber.<span class='pagenum'>597</span></p>

<p>"I understand nothing, sir, but I obey," answered
Helen, dutifully.</p>

<p>That evening Dame Hearty herself served his
lordship and the man whom he was pleased to represent
as his friend. Many were the questions that were put
to our hostess about her daughter, and many the
subterfuges she had to resort to in order to prevent
Helen from putting in an appearance. Whilst thus
engaged in conversation with the landlady, Jack Hearty
found it no difficult task to enter the sleeping room of
his guests and to extract all the bullets from their
pistols, without having recourse to Dr. Bleedem's
potent charm. The evening passed over quietly, and
there was no appearance of Helen.</p>

<p>A week now passed by, and neither Lord Scampford
nor his man seemed to be able to make any headway.
"Tell you what it is, Tuppings," said his lordship one
day to his bully, deeming himself unheard, although
every word fell distinctly on the ears of our host, "I
am getting tired of these eternal subterfuges. It's
enough to kill a man outright with <i>ennui</i>, to vegetate
day after day in this wilderness; yet leave the place
without her I <i>will</i> not."</p>

<p>"You may depend upon it, my lord," said the man
in black, "that they knew of our coming beforehand,
and have been forewarned."</p>

<p>"I wish I knew who it was," rejoined his lordship;
"I'ld be even with him. The only person interested in
the matter would be Lord Dodgemore, who naturally<span class='pagenum'>598</span>
would do all in his power to make me lose my wager.
I laid him a thousand pounds that I would make her
my mistress within a fortnight, and I don't intend to
become the laughing-stock of my friends on my
return."</p>

<p>"Then your lordship has not a moment to lose.
Half the time has already slipped by, and we are no
nearer than on the evening of our arrival," murmured
the bully.</p>

<p>"That we are being hoaxed is as plain as a pike-staff,"
observed his lordship.</p>

<p>"On our first evening the girl was engaged serving
the members of the club. The next day she was
indisposed and confined to her room. After that she
was on a visit to her aunt, who is ill, and what with one
excuse and then another&mdash;oh! it's sickening. I came
across the little jade unexpectedly the other day, and
tried to detain her with a little pleasant chat. You
should have seen the dignified air she put on, as with a
'by your leave, my lord, I am overpressed for time,'
she curtesyed and passed by. What has come to these
simple seeming rustics of late I am at a loss to
imagine."</p>

<p>"If your lordship should deign to follow my
advice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well."</p>

<p>"I would suggest that we should take the bull by the
horns and make short work of it."</p>

<p>"How?"<span class='pagenum'>599</span></p>

<p>"Pick the lock of her bedroom door. Gag her
and carry her out of bed downstairs, wrap a warm
cloak around her, and lift her into the carriage, which
must be waiting for us only a few paces off. Then,
head for the nearest township, and so on, to London.
In case of opposition on the way, we have our pistols.
But hush! I thought I heard footsteps."</p>

<p>"Tut! the walls are thick enough in this antique
hostelry," said his lordship.  "Never fear."</p>

<p>They little knew that there was a sliding panel high
up over the bedstead his lordship occupied, which was
covered by a bad picture of His Majesty George II.
on horseback, and which could be reached by a secret
staircase within the thickness of the wall.</p>

<p>"So that is their little game, is it?" muttered our
host to himself, who had been eavesdropping. "All
right, my men, all right."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>600</span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>


<p>It was the midnight hour, and the sky dark as pitch.
The wind howled dismally through the trees, and
seemed to shake the very foundations of this ancient
hostelry. All the inmates of the 'Headless Lady' had
retired to rest; that is to say, all the members of the
club. Our host above was stirring, and had not yet
made up his mind to go to roost. In fact, he seemed
disposed to make a night of it, and enjoy himself as
much as circumstances would permit.</p>

<p>The wind dashed the sleet against the window
panes, and the ground was getting fast covered with
snow. But our host stirred the fire, put on a fresh log,
and filled himself up a glass of his own home brewed
ale. First he took a sip, then setting his glass down,
he next walked leisurely into the room adjoining for
his tobacco box, with the intention of filling his yard of
clay. His back was no sooner turned than the bulky
figure of a man, in his stockinged feet, tripped lightly
across the hall, and, quick as thought, dexterously
emptied a white powder into the glass our host had
left standing, then as speedily vanished.<span class='pagenum'>601</span></p>

<p>He had hardly disappeared, when our host, suspecting
nothing, re-appeared upon the scene, and proceeded
to fill his churchwarden with some of his strongest
tobacco. He then lighted his pipe by the fire, and
throwing himself into an easy chair, puffed away
complacently for a time. He was apparently musing,
when, as if suddenly recollecting that his glass was at
his elbow, he raised it to his lips and drained it to the
dregs; making a wry face, as if he had just tossed off a
dose of physic. He was on the point of filling up again
from the jug close at hand, when a yawn escaped him.
He had grown unaccountably sleepy. This feeling he
at first endeavored to combat by having recourse to his
snuff box, but the effect of the pungent herb was only
temporary, for soon his eyelids fell, as if weighed down
with lead, and he was now snoring loud, and as utterly
oblivious as a corpse.</p>

<p>"I've drugged the old boy," said the man in black
to his master, with a chuckle. "It's all plain sailing
now. We've only got to pick the lock of the lady's
room, stuff a handkerchief in her mouth, and carry her
downstairs. The carriage is in readiness outside.
Quick! Let's up and be doing."</p>

<p>Upstairs tripped the ruffianly bully as lightly and
noiselessly as a grasshopper, followed closely by his
aristocratic patron, and in a moment the two men stood
before the chamber of the unconscious sleeper. It was
locked, as they had anticipated; but with a deftness that
argued much practice in this art, the bully soon<span class='pagenum'>602</span>
succeeded in causing the lock to yield, and the door
swung noiselessly back on its hinges. Aided by the
light of a taper, which his lordship carried, the ruffian
was enabled to make straight for the bed, and seizing
the fair sleeper roughly in his powerful arms, was in the
act of rushing downstairs with her when a shriek, so
loud and piercing that it bid fair to waken the dead,
resounded through the walls of this ancient hostel,
startling from their sleep all its inmates, save our host,
who was still as fast in the arms of Morpheus as when
we left him.</p>

<p>"Damnation!" cried the bully, between his teeth,
as he thrust a handkerchief into his victim's mouth,
and hurried with her towards the hall door, whilst Lord
Scampford followed close at his heels, a horse pistol in
either hand.</p>

<p>The door of the inn was soon unbolted, and before
any of the household could hurry to the spot, the pair
of scoundrels were already outside in the bleak night air,
and hailing his lordship's carriage, which now drew up.
The liveried footman had opened the door of the
carriage, and in another moment it would have closed
securely upon these two arrant scoundrels and their helpless
victim, while a crack of the coachman's whip would
have carried them miles out of reach of all human
opposition, had not at this juncture something quite
unforeseen occurred.</p>

<p>From out the darkness a cloaked figure, with broad
sombrero drawn down tightly over his eyes, suddenly
<span class='pagenum'>603</span>
emerged, and with a well-directed blow from a leaden-headed
cane upon the bare head of the man in black,
felled the gigantic bully, who measured his full length
upon the ground covered with snow, still clasping in his
arms the terrified and trembling form of our heroine,
whose shrieks of "murder" and cries for help at length
brought all the members of the club to the spot.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 1024px;">

<img src="images/dtwc603p.jpg" width="1024" height="688" alt="The Duel" title="The Duel" />
</div>

<p>Before they arrived, however, the mysterious stranger,
who had so opportunely come to the rescue, had
succeeded in releasing Helen from the clasp of the
unconscious ruffian, and carried her inside, but not
before Lord Scampford had discharged his brace of
horse pistols at him&mdash;we need not say without any
effect, save that of startling the horses so terribly that
they became perfectly unmanageable, and bolted with
the carriage, before the footman had time to spring to the
box. His lordship, finding his pistols useless, flung them
from him, and drawing his rapier, made for the stranger,
who likewise drew <i>his</i> sword, and a skirmish ensued.</p>

<p>At this moment all the inmates of "The Headless
Lady" hurried downstairs, half dressed, with lighted
candles, and armed with what weapons of offence they
could first lay their hands upon. One carried a
torch, by the light of which the spectators could clearly
note the position of affairs. Lord Scampford and the
Unknown were still in the thick of the fray, and appeared
well matched, when suddenly an opening presented
itself, and the sword of the Unknown pierced the heart
of his lordship, who fell back lifeless on the snow.<span class='pagenum'>604</span></p>

<p>The greatest confusion reigned. Questions were
asked on all hands, and no one seemed to be wiser
than his neighbour, yet the main facts of the case were
apparent to all. Helen had retreated hurriedly to her
chamber, and locked herself in afresh. Our host seemed
not yet sufficiently conscious to be able to take in the
situation. It was not till the small hours of the morning
that each returned to his bed. On looking round
for the stranger he had vanished.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>Now, it will readily be imagined that at the breakfast
table next morning, at which our members assembled
rather late, little else was discussed save the adventures
of the previous night.</p>

<p>"The scoundrels!" thundered out Mr. Oldstone,
with an indignant snort.</p>

<p>"The villains!" chimed in Professor Cyanite and
Mr. Crucible together.</p>

<p>"The world is well rid of such a pair of jail birds,"
said Mr. Hardcase; "only it is a pity that they were
allowed to cheat the gallows."</p>

<p>"Poor Helen!" sighed Parnassus; "I think there
is matter for an epic poem in her misadventure."</p>

<p>"You are right," agreed Mr. Blackdeed. "The
incident was pre-eminently dramatic; just suited to
the stage, and would certainly bring down the house.
I intend to dramatise it at my earliest convenience."<span class='pagenum'>605</span></p>

<p>"And how is our patient, Dame Hearty?" enquired
Dr. Bleedem of our hostess, who was waiting upon the
members at table this morning instead of her daughter.</p>

<p>"Still very feverish, doctor," was the reply. "The
poor child has caught a dreadful cold from being turned
out of her warm bed and carried into the cold night air
and the snow by those ruffians, and she with scarce a
stitch of clothing on."</p>

<p>"Poor dear!" cried Dr. Bleedem, compassionately.
"I'll come and see how she is getting on after breakfast."</p>

<p>"Why, doctor," observed Mr. Crucible, "you've got
your work pretty well cut out for you. There's his lordship&mdash;well,
you can dissect him; and his man, too, for
the matter of that. Then there's the coachman, who
was brought back here in his lordship's carriage early
this morning, with his shoulder-blade broken; then the
horses, with their knees broken: and now it's our sweet
Helen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say, doctor," broke in Professor Cyanite, "was
that rascally bully sufficiently conscious before his death
to give an account of himself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he was conscious, though he hadn't time
to say much. I saw from the first that the case was
fatal.  He admitted that he had been a d&mdash;&mdash;d
scoundrel, but added that his lordship was every whit
as bad&mdash;and worse. He alleged that had he taken a
situation as servant under an honest man, instead of
entering the service of an unprincipled rake and<span class='pagenum'>606</span>
debauchee like Lord Scampford, that he himself might
have become an honest man. He showed some contrition
for the part he had played last night, and begged
me to ask the lady's forgiveness for the same, as well as
to pray for his soul. Then his mind seemed to wander,
and he called out: 'There's his lordship! I see him
enveloped in a sheet of flame, with fire issuing from his
eyes and mouth, and from the tips of his fingers. He
is beckoning to me! He is calling me down to Hell!
How horrible the forms that hover round me. Mercy!
mercy! Oh! my God,' Here he uttered a despairing
groan, and spoke no more."</p>

<p>"Ha! Quite dramatic again," remarked the
tragedian, who had no thought but what had reference
to the stage; "the repentant sinner on his
death-bed&mdash;excellent! I will take a note of that, and
introduce it into my next play."</p>

<p>"Then there is the rescuer; you forget him,"
observed the poet. "The mysterious stranger, with
cloak and slouched hat, appearing on the spot in the
very nick of time to succour Beauty in distress."</p>

<p>"True, true," assented the tragedian; "I had nigh
forgot. If this episode wouldn't bring down the house
I don't know what would."</p>

<p>"I wonder who he was," observed Mr. Oldstone.
"His sudden appearance was most remarkable; his disappearance
no less so."</p>

<p>In the middle of this discussion, the door opened,
and our host entered with a letter, which he handed to<span class='pagenum'>607</span>
the antiquary, who mechanically put it in his pocket as
of no immediate importance, without even looking at the
handwriting, while he joined in the merry banter of the
other members, who, as soon as our landlord made his
appearance fixed upon him at once as the butt of their
satire.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Jack!" cried one, "got over your little nap
at last, eh?"</p>

<p>"That last glass of your home-brewed ale, by way
of a night cap was most effectual," jeered another.</p>

<p>Our host, however, did not view the matter by any
means in the light of a joke, and answered savagely,
"Ah! the dastardly cowards! They <i>did</i> me at last.
Can't make out how they found time to do it. Such a
trick was never played me before, and I'll take jolly
good care they don't catch me again."</p>

<p>"Well, that's not likely under the circumstances,
is it, Jack?" replied Mr. Hardcase.</p>

<p>"Just like these lawyer fellows," observed Professor
Cyanite, "they are always tripping one up."</p>

<p>"Nor yet anyone else," persisted the landlord. Then
added, "To think that <i>my</i> daughter who has been
brought up from a kid under my very eyes, and never
seen no one save her parents and you gentlemen of the
club, who have always treated her with courtesy as
though she were a high born lady&mdash;she, what's never
heard a word in her life as she didn't oughter have
heard&mdash;what never knowed nothink of the ways of this
wicked world&mdash;that <i>she</i>, poor child, should be subjected<span class='pagenum'>608</span>
to outrage from two ruffianly bullies&mdash;one o' them a
peer of the realm, forsooth, and all on account of her
picter being exhibited at that d&mdash;&mdash;d Royal Academy!"
He concluded with a thump of his fist on the breakfast
table that set all the cups and saucers rattling, and felt
better afterwards.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was a narrow shave. Wasn't it, Jack?"
remarked Parnassus. "If it hadn't been for that
stranger&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! I'ld like to find out who <i>he</i> was. <i>That</i> I
would. Can any of you gentlemen guess?" demanded
our host.</p>

<p>"Not I."</p>

<p>"Nor I," replied several voices at once.</p>

<p>"Why on earth don't he show hisself?" asked
Jack. "Well, he's a trump, whoever he is, say I."</p>

<p>The company now broke up, and the members of
the club began to set about their several avocations.
Dr. Bleedem went upstairs to visit his fair patient, and
Mr. Oldstone found himself once more alone. He
paced the room slowly, with his hands clasped behind
his back and his chin upon his breast, as if lost in a
reverie. Then suddenly blurted out, with a snort, "The
d&mdash;&mdash;d rascals!  The double-dyed sons of Belial!
To dare to carry off <i>my</i> Helen! That sweet child that
I love as if she were my own flesh and blood. And how
nearly they succeeded!" Here his eyes filled with
tears, and thrusting his hand into his large pocket in
search of his handkerchief, his fingers clutched something
<span class='pagenum'>609</span>
crisp, and he recollected the letter that Jack
Hearty had put into his hand at breakfast. "Some
shoemaker's bill, I suppose," he muttered, as he mopped
his eyes with his handkerchief. "Hullo!" he exclaimed,
glancing at the handwriting. "What! am I dreaming?
Isn't this the writing of my young friend Vandyke
McGuilp? But how? I am only just in possession of
his letter from Rome, and this letter bears no postmark,
being brought here by some casual messenger. Then
he must be <i>here</i>! Don't understand it at all." Here
he broke the seal and read as follows:</p>

<div class="bblockquot">
<p class="center">"<i>Letter from Mr. Vandyke McGuilp to Mr. Oldstone</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I am nearer to you than you imagine. I
send these lines by a boy from a neighbouring village,
where I slept last night, but which I leave this morning,
without being able to call upon you, as I have important
family business in the adjacent county of &mdash;&mdash; which
I cannot afford to neglect. I had no sooner
sent off to you my last letter, dated from Rome, when I
received orders to return post haste to England at all
costs, as my uncle had been taken suddenly ill, and
now lies on his death-bed. He is not expected to last
long, and I must be in the house when he dies, and
remain till the funeral is over.</p>

<p>"I daren't risk seeing you even for a moment, but I
<i>had</i> to be very near you last night, though you knew
me not. I had heard from the gossip of the village that<span class='pagenum'>610</span>
a grand carriage and pair with liveried coachman and
footman were putting up at 'The Headless Lady,' and
I guessed the worst and prepared myself accordingly to
frustrate the diabolical plans of those villains. If I were
to be hanged to-morrow for it, I should die happy in
the consciousness of having rescued innocence from the
clutches of vice.</p>

<p>"Immediately after the fray I reported myself to
the authorities, who will by this time have sent over a
constable to the hostel to interview his lordship's coachman
and footman. For the present I am free, but I am
bound to appear when called for at the next assizes.
Matters are apt to go hard with a commoner like
myself when the slain man happens to be a person of
title; but I have hopes, as both the serving men are
bound to give evidence that my act was to protect
innocence; also that Lord Scampford first drew his
sword upon me, having previously attempted to shoot
me. No more for the present. With kind remembrances
to all,&mdash;I remain,</p>

<p style='text-align: right'>
"Your very faithful friend, &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
"<span class="smcap">Vandyke McGuilp</span>." &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Our antiquary had hardly finished reading the letter,
and thrust it into his pocket, when Dr. Bleedem re-entered
the room with a very serious expression on his
face.</p>

<p>"Well, doctor," said Mr. Oldstone cheerily, not
noticing his countenance, "What news?"<span class='pagenum'>611</span></p>

<p>"Bad, bad, very bad indeed," replied the leech
gravely. "She is in a high fever and delirious. Quite
off her head. If I ever get her through this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good heavens! doctor," ejaculated Oldstone, "you
don't mean to say that there is any actual danger of her
life?"</p>

<p>"Very considerable danger, I am afraid," responded
the physician. "She will require the most careful
nursing, such as I am afraid she is not likely to get
even from her own mother."</p>

<p>"Doctor, you frighten me," cried Oldstone. "Surely
someone can be found to attend upon her to relieve her
mother."</p>

<p>"They are a rough lot about here, and not always
dependable," answered Bleedem. "It must be someone
who will remain with her all night long without going to
sleep. If she ever <i>should</i> get over it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! doctor. She <i>must</i> get over it, if <i>I</i> myself
have to sit up to attend upon her."</p>

<p>"Well, well, we must see how we can manage; but
it is a very bad case, for besides the chill she caught,
which was of itself enough, there was, in addition, the
mental shock to the nervous system. She is so delicately
organised."</p>

<p>"Poor dear! poor dear!" whimpered Oldstone.
"If <i>she</i> dies under your treatment, doctor, I shall
never&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Under <i>my</i> treatment!" exclaimed Dr. Bleedem,
with vehemence. "God bless the man! She'ld die<span class='pagenum'>612</span>
all the sooner under anyone else's. Do you think I
shan't do my best to bring her round&mdash;if it were only
for my reputation. If <i>I</i> fail, no man in the whole wide
world will be able to save her."</p>

<p>Our antiquary then, by way of changing the conversation,
fearing he had somewhat nettled the physician,
inquired, "By the way, doctor, did she discourse much
during her delirium?"</p>

<p>"Lord, yes; a lot of rubbish, of course," replied the
leech. "Imagined she was undergoing again the adventure
of last night. Thought Lord Scampford was after
her with his bully. Stretched out her arms for succour
towards an imaginary angel, whom she said had been
sent down from heaven to protect her; ever and anon
confounding him with Mr. McGuilp."</p>

<p>Here the man of medicine indulged in the ghost of
a smile.</p>

<p>"Did she indeed, doctor? Well, this is most
interesting. Now, while you have a moment of leisure,
oblige me by reading this letter."</p>

<p>Here the antiquary handed over the epistle of our
artist to Dr. Bleedem.</p>

<p>The physician seized it gravely, read it through in
silence to the end; re-read it, slowly folded it up, and
returned it to Oldstone.</p>

<p>"Humph! remarkable&mdash;very," he observed, after a
pause.</p>

<p>Further discussion on the subject was checked by
the entry of the other members for their mid-day meal,<span class='pagenum'>613</span>
during which no secret was made as to the identity of
the mysterious stranger.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well," cried our host, when the mystery
had been cleared up. "If I didn't half suspect it all
along. Why, bless my soul, if I think there could be
found another man in the world capable of it. Eh,
Molly?"</p>

<p>As for our hostess, she went right off into hysterics,
and Mr. Oldstone was not the only member of the club
who was visibly affected.</p>

<p>A month had passed over, and it was now time for
the case of that memorable night to be tried at the
assizes. Our host, the two serving men, and every
member of the club had received a summons to appear
as witnesses. Helen herself would have been obliged
to put in an appearance, had not Dr. Bleedem signed a
certificate that her state of health prevented her from
attending. The greatest excitement prevailed when
our artist appeared in court. Nearly all were prepossessed
in his favour, and several women were overheard
to express hopes that they would not hang so
good-looking a man. The two serving men were then
called, one after the other, and both deposed that their
deceased master, Lord Scampford, had first drawn his
sword on the gentleman, who was forced to act on the
defensive.</p>

<p>The case was soon settled. The jury brought it in
as justifiable homicide, and in spite of some ineffectual
opposition on the part of the family of the defunct Lord<span class='pagenum'>614</span>
Scampford, who wondered what had come of nobility
in these times, when a mere commoner like the defendant
could waylay and assassinate a peer of the realm
and get off unscathed, etc., etc. In spite, however, of
all opposition, our artist was acquitted and left the court
without a stain on his character, amid the cheers and
congratulations of the crowd. As he left the court
house he was accompanied to the "Headless Lady" by
all the members of the club, who vied with each other
in the cordiality of their welcome.</p>

<p>Many changes of importance had taken place of
late. Our artist's relative had long since breathed his
last, and he now slept with his fathers. His nephew had
sat up with him to the end, and was chief mourner at
his funeral. The will of deceased had been read, and
our friend Vandyke McGuilp was known to have
inherited his entire fortune, which was considerable, so
that the once struggling limner was now little short of a
millionaire.</p>

<p>A sudden change for the better had taken place in
the health of our heroine, which now mended apace in
a way that surprised the doctor. Still, it was deemed
advisable, for the present, to keep her in ignorance of
her hero's arrival on the scene.</p>

<p>After some discussion on the subject, <i>i.e.</i>, when her
medical attendant pronounced her out of all danger, it
was generally agreed upon that considering the great
confidence which had always existed between Mr. Oldstone
and the daughter of our host, that he should be<span class='pagenum'>615</span>
the man entrusted to break the joyful news to the
patient.</p>

<p>Our antiquary accordingly bent him to the task; so
mounting the staircase, he tapped at the patient's door.
On entering the chamber, he was greeted by a beaming
smile from its fair occupant.</p>

<p>"Why! my pretty pet!" cried the old man, cheerily,
"what a time it seems since I saw you last! Why!
you <i>are</i> pulled down, poor dear."</p>

<p>"Am I?" answered Helen. "I am feeling much
better now, though; and I am getting tired of lying in
bed all day. I feel quite well now, and want to get up."</p>

<p>"Don't do anything without Dr. Bleedem's permission,"
remonstrated Oldstone, "or you may throw
yourself back, and then what should we all do without
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Dr. Bleedem says I have been most seriously
ill&mdash;that he has just rescued me from the jaws of death."</p>

<p>"Ah!" remarked the antiquary with a quiet smile,
"and someone else rescued you quite lately from something
very like the jaws of death&mdash;only worse," he added,
in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, covering her face with her hands,
as if to shut out some horrible vision; "don't mention
those two villainous men, or I shall go mad."</p>

<p>"No, no; we won't mention them again. They
have gone to their account at last&mdash;and&mdash;there, there,
let us not judge, but try to forgive, as we ourselves
would wish to be forgiven," said Oldstone.<span class='pagenum'>616</span></p>

<p>"But what harm had I done them? Why should
they&mdash;I mean, what did they want to do to me?" asked
the girl, ingenuously.</p>

<p>"<i>Do</i> to you, silly child! He! he! What all
wicked men seek to do when they get the chance,"
replied her friend. "Let us not talk of them, but
rather of the brave man who rescued you in the very
nick of time from a living death."</p>

<p>"I understand nothing of their object, and I can't
get anyone to explain to me; but I want to know more
of the brave man who, at the risk of his own life, came
to my assistance."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can tell you something of <i>him</i>, too," said
Oldstone, mysteriously. "Did you note him well?"</p>

<p>"Not I. How could I? I was half fainting when
he carried me into the hall. Besides, he was so muffled
up in a cloak and hat that I was unable to see his face."</p>

<p>"True; neither could any of us&mdash;he was so successfully
disguised. But we have discovered since who he
was, for all that."</p>

<p>"Then you have seen him&mdash;spoken to him? Please
convey him my most sincere thanks and blessings for
his heroic conduct towards a perfect stranger."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would like to thank him yourself&mdash;some
day&mdash;when you are able to get up, and feel quite
well again," suggested Oldstone.</p>

<p>"I suppose I ought," replied Helen. "I feel most
grateful to him, I am sure; for don't I owe him my
life? But I am so shy with strangers&mdash;and&mdash;and I<span class='pagenum'>617</span>
don't know what to say," pleaded the girl. Then, at
length, "Tell me what manner of man he is?"</p>

<p>"Oh! he's a gentleman," replied Oldstone; "you
may depend upon that&mdash;and, what is more, he's young,
and, <i>I</i> think, very good-looking. I am sure you would
say so, too."</p>

<p>Here a knowing look came into the antiquary's
face, which puzzled the patient, who, with eyes and
mouth wide open, appeared to scan his countenance as
if to read the very secrets of his soul. Then, like a
Pythoness of old, suddenly inspired, she exclaimed,
"I have it! In vain you try to keep it from me. Mr.
McGuilp has returned. It was <i>he</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Oldstone marvelled at her penetration, but replied
only by a succession of little nods of his head, fixing his
eyes steadily, yet laughingly, upon her the while.</p>

<p>"I knew it; I knew it!" she exclaimed. "My
dreams confirmed it. Oh, God be praised," and she
clasped her hands in ecstasy.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself; calm yourself, my sweet one,"
began Oldstone, now seriously alarmed lest the patient
should suffer a relapse, "What would Dr. Bleedem
say to me if he knew I had been so precipitate?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Bleedem! Does <i>he</i> then know of our&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I never said anything to him about it, you
may be sure. What I mean is&mdash;he wishes you to be
spared all emotion, lest you should throw yourself back,
and all his care be in vain."</p>

<p>"Oh! no fear of that," replied Helen. "I feel so<span class='pagenum'>618</span>
much better since you told me. Stay!&mdash;if you have seen
him, he is here. Perhaps in this very inn&mdash;tell me!"</p>

<p>"Well, not very far off, I dare say," said Oldstone,
cautiously.</p>

<p>"Mr. Oldstone!" cried the girl, "you can hide
nothing from me. I <i>know</i> he is here, and I <i>insist</i> upon
seeing him."</p>

<p>"My dear! my dear! How can you? Just think!
You must wait till you are well enough to get up,"
protested her friend and counsellor. "Dr. Bleedem
will decide all that."</p>

<p>"I want to see him <i>now</i>, <i>this instant</i>."</p>

<p>"What! In your bedroom!" exclaimed Oldstone.
"My dear child! It's not proper."</p>

<p>"Then why do you come yourself, and Dr.
Bleedem?"</p>

<p>"That is a very different matter? I am an old
man, and Dr. Bleedem is your medical attendant,"
replied the antiquary. "Mr. McGuilp is young&mdash;and
people <i>might</i> talk."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! If you don't let me see him, I'll make
myself ill and die," exclaimed the patient, petulantly.</p>

<p>The antiquary began to be alarmed, but tried to
pacify her by saying he would see Dr. Bleedem, and
consult with him as to what were best to be done.</p>

<p>As he did so, the doctor mounted the stairs. He
came to administer a cordial.</p>

<p>"She seems much better now, doctor," remarked
Mr. Oldstone.<span class='pagenum'>619</span></p>

<p>Here a muttered consultation took place just
outside the patient's door. After which the physician
entered the sick-room, and finding his patient's nerves
somewhat excited, administered a calm soothing dose
which sent her off into a peaceful sleep, while our
antiquary sought his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and explained that,
owing to the patient having taken a composing draught,
the doctor's advice was, that he had better postpone
his visit till the morrow.</p>

<p>Our artist's disappointment at being refused an
interview with his <i>inamorata</i> after so long an absence
may be imagined, but he was consoled in a measure by
the doctor's promise that she would be well enough to
see him on the following day. On one thing he had
thoroughly made up his mind, and that was to ask her
in marriage of her father. He had never ceased to
love her all the time he had been absent, but up to the
present he had no position to offer her. Were she to
marry one of the many country bumpkins who flocked
around her, it would be affluence to what he could have
offered her. He could not afford to have quarrelled
with his only relative. The consequences would have
been fatal. Now everything had changed. He was
rich, and could afford to please himself. Therefore on
the morrow he was resolved to speak to her father.</p>

<p>It will readily be imagined that our artist's return to
his native land, to say nothing of the chain of events
that followed&mdash;his heroism, his trial and acquittal, were
events that could not be passed over without celebration.<span class='pagenum'>620</span>
Therefore it is needless to say that the evening was spent
round the merry punch bowl, as usual on festive occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. Oldstone was again elected chairman, which
post none of the members felt inclined to dispute with
him. The evening opened with a congratulatory speech
from the chairman, addressed to our artist, to which he
replied with brevity and grace. To say that his health
was drunk with the usual three times three would be
superfluous.</p>

<p>Jack Hearty was called in to join in the toast and
invited to take a seat, while our artist was called upon
by the members of the club to give an account of his
adventures among the brigands, which he did in a
manner so graphic, and with such grace and easy
command of language, that the company remained
spellbound, drinking in every detail of his narrative,
whether it were a description of natural scenery or
climate&mdash;the dress or physiognomy of his captors&mdash;their
attitudes, their language, or what not. Nothing was
forgotten. His trials and privations, his thoughts of
home, and the friends he had left behind him. (He
mentioned nothing of the girl he left behind him).
Then he described the final tussle with the carabineers,
and his subsequent rescue. Thus he rambled on in
one continual flow of diction like a mill stream without
interruption, carried away by his enthusiasm in such a
manner as to leave no doubt in the minds of his hearers
as to his having taken part himself in the adventures he
described.<span class='pagenum'>621</span></p>

<p>"Now, mine host," said the chairman, at the
conclusion of this somewhat prolonged narrative, "what
do you say to that?"</p>

<p>"Well, well, well," replied that worthy, musingly.
"To think that all that should have happened to one
of my gentlemen customers, what's been in furren parts.
Why, it beats the story books out and out. Blessed if
I can't see it all a goin' on before my very eyes."</p>

<p>"True, Jack," agreed Mr. Oldstone, "such is the
power of our young friend's eloquence, that one feels
that we ourselves have taken part in it."</p>

<p>"Might I point out to the company," began Mr.
Blackdeed, "the intensely dramatic situation of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Also the highly poetical episode&mdash;&mdash;" broke in
Mr. Parnassus.</p>

<p>"And if you had been there," interrupted our
artist in his turn, "you would have noticed the vivid
colouring, the fine grouping of the figures, the chiaroscuro&mdash;the
fantastic light and shade that would have
impressed the scene upon your memory in a way never
to be forgotten."</p>

<p>"Hark at him! Hark at him!" cried several members
at once, as they refilled their glasses from the
punch-bowl.</p>

<p>The conversation then drifted towards more recent
adventures, and our artist explained in full his sudden
appearance on the spot in time to frustrate the designs
of the ravishers, and rescue innocence from pollution.</p>

<p>"And to think that you rescued <i>my</i> daughter from<span class='pagenum'>622</span>
those ruffians, sir, and at the risk of your own life, too.
Why it was admirable! But there, sir, I can't find
no words to thank you with&mdash;that I can't."</p>

<p>Here our worthy host became very moist; but the
chairman filled up his glass again for him, which he
tossed off at a gulp, and felt better.</p>

<p>"And now, gentlemen," said the chairman, rising,
"just one more toast before I dismiss this honourable
meeting, which I am sure you will all join in. Here is
'Health, long life, and happiness, both to the rescuer
and the rescued!'"&mdash;(Shouts of "Hear, hear!" and
"Yes; none but the brave deserve the fair.")&mdash;"Then,
here goes with a 'Hip! hip! hip!&mdash;hurrah!'"</p>

<p>Our artist, somewhat taken aback, blushed up to his
scalp, and drank off the toast good humouredly, after
which there was shaking of hands all round, and every
one retired to his dormitory in a comfortable frame of
mind and body.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p>Need it be told how, on the following morning, as
soon after breakfast as convenient, our artist&mdash;and now
rich land-proprietor&mdash;beckoned to our host of the
"Headless Lady," and with trembling lips and palpitating
heart seized him by the arm, and walked with
him for a good pace down the long, straight road leading
up to the door of the inn? Or how the members
of the club, who happened to be looking through the
diamond-shaped panes of the old-fashioned bow window
in that direction, remarked one to the other how mighty
intimate our hero had suddenly become with his landlord,
and their wonderments as to what he could find to
talk to him about so confidentially?</p>

<p>Suddenly our host was observed to start, slap his
thigh, then, with a hand upon each bent knee, he peers
steadily into the face of his interlocutor, who is placing
a hand upon his shoulder. Our host, now changing his
position, extends a broad, fleshy palm towards his customer,
which our artist clasps in his long, slender fingers
with a more than usual hearty shake.</p>

<p>"Why, if they are not patting each other on the<span class='pagenum'>624</span>
back, and laughing," exclaimed Parnassus. "What <i>can</i>
be up?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's queer," observed the Professor. "Um&mdash;m&mdash;m&mdash;m?"</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>Whilst this dumb show was being enacted Dame
Hearty entered her daughter's bedroom to announce to
her that she had Dr. Bleedem's full permission to get
up and dress herself; which permission, we may easily
guess, was promptly taken advantage of. So jumping
suddenly out of bed with the agility of youth, she
quickly set about her toilet and ablutions.</p>

<p>"There is one thing," began her parent, "I wish to
speak to you about."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother," responded Helen, absently, brushing
out her curls before the glass with unusual despatch,
and without turning towards her parent.</p>

<p>"Nay, hear me, girl," continued Dame Hearty; "it
is seriously I would speak."</p>

<p>"Say on, then, madam; I am listening."</p>

<p>"I am aware&mdash;ahem!&mdash;I have long taken note,"
continued her mother, "of a growing intimacy&mdash;a
friendship, I may say, and perhaps something more&mdash;between
you and this Mr. McGuilp, our guest. I know
that he has done us all a great service&mdash;a service that
none of us can ever forget, and you in particular, since
he saved your life. It is therefore only natural and
proper that you should feel grateful towards him, and<span class='pagenum'>625</span>
regard him in the light of a friend, and as a friend,
I hope, we shall ever esteem him; but listen, now, my
girl, to what I say. A <i>too</i> intimate friendship between a
young couple, out of different stations in life, such as in
the case of yourself, who are only the daughter of a
country inn-keeper, and a gentleman born and educated
like Mr. McGuilp, who is, besides, enormously rich,
having inherited all his uncle's fortune and estates, and
consequently moves in the very best society. Such
intimacies are dangerous, and may lead on to trouble
before you are aware."</p>

<p>"How, mother?"</p>

<p>"Bless the child!" answered her mother, impatiently,
"must I tell you everything? Must I make you as
wise as myself? No; there are things I can't discuss
with you. What I want of you is to be patient, and obey."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;all of you&mdash;treat me like a child," broke in
Helen, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"And so you are," retorted her mother; "therefore
take advice. The feeling that the world calls <i>love</i>&mdash;love,
I say, that speaks not of marriage is denounced as
<i>sin</i> by the laws of God and man."</p>

<p>"Well, that's strange," mused Helen. "Then, one
may not love a friend, a parent, a child, without marrying
them?"</p>

<p>"I have no time to quibble," replied her mother,
with some asperity, "but would simply remark that
whatever your feelings may be towards Mr. McGuilp, or
his towards <i>you</i>, nothing but harm and unhappiness can<span class='pagenum'>626</span>
be the lot of you both&mdash;without marriage. Now, you
can't well expect a rich gentleman like Mr. McGuilp to
displease all his friends by marrying a penniless girl
like yourself&mdash;country bred, without education, who
knows nothing of the world and society, when he could
marry some high-born lady out of his own class&mdash;some
rich heiress, educated and accomplished, who would
grace the society to which he belongs. He might be a
great man in the county, and enter Parliament, with
such a wife, while you would only drag him down to
your level."</p>

<p>Helen had already hidden her face in her hands, and
her bare shoulders heaved convulsively, while the hot
tears trickled through her fingers.</p>

<p>"Cease, mother! Oh! cease, in pity!" she cried.
"I cannot bear it."</p>

<p>Her anguish would have wrung the heart of a stone,
and her parent being a really tender-hearted woman,
deeply sympathised with her daughter, though she felt
it her duty to be firm, "For what could it all end in?"
she argued.</p>

<p>At this juncture, the voice of our host was heard at
the bottom of the staircase calling out, "Molly, my
dear! Mr. McGuilp wants to speak to you."</p>

<p>"In one moment, Jack," answered his spouse. Then
to her daughter, "Dry your eyes, my girl. Bathe your
face and follow me. Mr. McGuilp doubtless wants to
see you. You have much to thank him for, and do it
with grace, but mind what I have said."<span class='pagenum'>627</span></p>

<p>With this parting admonition she left the room and
hurried downstairs, whilst Helen deftly finished her
toilet, and with one last look at the glass to ascertain
that her eyes bore no traces of weeping, she was preparing
to descend the stairs, when her attention was
attracted by sounds from below that she was at a loss
to account for. There was a jumble of human voices,
but above them all was the voice of her mother, now
screaming, now half laughing and half crying, whilst
that of Dr. Bleedem was heard giving orders to her
father, and all seemed bustle and confusion. Dame
Hearty was in hysterics.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>"And you really do mean it, Mr. McGuilp?" asked,
in a sweet voice, a bright-faced country girl of eighteen
summers of a slim young man in the garb of a gentleman,
who followed her through the narrow mossy pathway
of a wood adjacent to the inn at the cross roads.</p>

<p>"Mean it, my angel! Why, of course I do, and
feel proud at the very thought of you being all my own.
Only don't call me any more 'Mr. McGuilp,' or 'Sir.'
It hurts my feelings. Call me 'Van'&mdash;just 'Van' as
my friends and relatives have ever called me."</p>

<p>"Van, let it be then," quoth the maiden, "<i>dear</i> Van,
my own sweet love for ever and ever! Oh! Van, you
<i>have</i> made me so happy! And my parents, how you
must have surprised them when you told them! Poor
mother! No wonder she went into highstrikes!"<span class='pagenum'>628</span></p>

<p>"Hysterics," corrected her lover.</p>

<p>"Well, that's what they call them here," answered
the girl; "but you will correct me every time I make a
mistake, won't you Van?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure, dearest," replied her suitor.</p>

<p>"And nothing can ever come between us now?
Nothing can part us?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but death," was the reply.</p>

<p>A shade of sadness passed momentarily over the
girl's features as she asked, "Must it all end with that?"</p>

<p>"Death ends everything," replied the young man:
"that is to say, everything earthly."</p>

<p>"Then is there <i>no</i> love beyond the grave?" asked
Helen.</p>

<p>"Oh! let us hope so," responded our artist. "I, for
one, have the very strongest persuasion that there is.
Love such as ours is not merely of earth."</p>

<p>"Dear, <i>dear</i> Van!" cried the maiden, in ecstasy, "I
will believe all you tell me. <i>I</i> know nothing, but I <i>feel</i>
you are right. Yes, we shall still continue to love even
beyond the grave. Oh! Van, how have I deserved all
this happiness?"</p>

<p>"Your sweetness, your goodness, your beauty, your
love, amply counterpoise anything <i>I</i> can give you, my
angel," said her lover.</p>

<p>"How kind you are to talk like that Van! How
you <i>must</i> love me to go against the wishes of your
friends and leave everything and everybody for me!"
exclaimed the girl. Then added, "You are <i>quite</i> sure<span class='pagenum'>629</span>
that you won't be ashamed of me before all the grand
people you will meet? That you will be able to pardon
any little slip of the tongue, my country manners, and
everything else?"</p>

<p>"Everything, everything, dear. Besides, your education
will begin from to-day. You will improve yourself
in the arts of reading and writing. Learn grammar,
history, geography, and other things. I will have you
well taught at once, whilst I am away in town to make
preparations for our wedding. I must go about the
licence, and through other formalities; buy the wedding-ring;
your dress&mdash;for, of course, as <i>my</i> wife, you must
now dress as beseems a lady, and leave off this simple
garb; and yet it seems a pity, for I have always known
you thus. Still, for the sake of public opinion&mdash;to
avoid misunderstanding&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I care nothing about all that," broke in Helen.</p>

<p>"No, my darling; not yet. You do not understand.
But in time you will find that you have to."</p>

<p>"Well, I will do anything to please you, Van."</p>

<p>"My own darling!" said her lover, encircling his
arm around her waist.</p>

<p>Well, my readers, and if their lips <i>did</i> meet; what of
it? It is a way that lips have under the circumstances.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>"And now, gentlemen, and members of the Wonder
Club, let me introduce you to the future Mrs. Vandyke
McGuilp," said our artist, on his return from his walk,<span class='pagenum'>630</span>
as he entered the club room, leading his fianc&eacute;e by
the hand.</p>

<p>Taken completely by surprise, each member rose
from his chair, bowed, smiled, and offered his congratulations.
Mr. Oldstone was particularly moist on this
occasion.</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear boy, how I congratulate you; and
you too, my pretty child! Bless you, my children,
both!"</p>

<p>Then he took out his handkerchief and mopped his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Dear me, what an old fool I am!" he muttered, in
parenthesis.</p>

<p>Chairs were immediately placed for the engaged
couple, amid boisterous cheering and banter from all the
members of the club at once, whilst the bride elect
laughed, blushed, and looked very happy. The father
and mother of the bride next entered, and joined in the
general hubbub.</p>

<p>Of course, this was too great an event not to be
celebrated with all due honours. Therefore Mr.
Oldstone proposed that they should all meet once again
that evening round the steaming punch-bowl; Helen
and her parents being also of the company.</p>

<p>"Just to drink to the health of the bride elect,"
explained Mr. Oldstone with an appealing look towards
Dr. Bleedem. And it was so.</p>

<p>That the bride's health was drunk that evening with
a "Hip, hip, hurrah!" goes without saying. How Mr.<span class='pagenum'>631</span>
McGuilp started on the morrow for town on business
connected with his approaching marriage; his return;
his sojourn at the "Headless Lady" until the grand
event came off; how he occupied his spare time partly
in painting a portrait of his friend Mr. Oldstone, which
was followed in due time by portraits of his future father
and mother-in-law, and in imparting instruction to his
fair bride; likewise, how, when unavoidably absent on
business, Mr. Oldstone would enact the r&ocirc;le of instructor
to the fair bride of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, so that no time should
be lost in fitting her for her exalted station; how
Helen improved daily in intelligence and knowledge
under such careful tuition, are matters of history.</p>

<p>All unpleasant experiences of the past had been
forgotten in the joy attending the great approaching
event.</p>

<p>Coffins had been made for the bodies of the two
malefactors. The corpse of Lord Scampford had been
placed in his lordship's carriage and driven by his
coachman (whose shoulder blade was now quite well),
and accompanied by his footman to London, where it
was consigned to the family vault of the Scampfords,
while that of his partner in crime filled a nameless grave
in a corner of the old churchyard at Littleboro'.</p>

<p>Some procrastination and unexpected delays <i>would</i>
occur, however, in spite of all our hero could do to
hurry on the event, for we know that "the course of
true love never <i>did</i> run smooth," but at length the
happy day arrived.  How merrily pealed the bells from<span class='pagenum'>632</span>
the ruined tower of the picturesque old parish church
of Littleboro' on that sunny morn! How gay the
peasantry looked in their holiday attire! Proud,
indeed, were our host and hostess as a splendid
equipage with coachman and footman, each adorned
with a huge nosegay, drove up to the door of the
"Headless Lady" to convey the fair bride, who was
attired in the most approved fashion of the period, and
accompanied by her father and mother, both clad in
gala, to the church.</p>

<p>How the yokels did gape as they recognised in the
magnificently attired bride poor Nell Hearty, maid of
the inn at the cross roads, whom they had seen full oft
to feed the pigs, milk the cows, scrub the steps, wash
and hang out the clothes, and who had served them
with many a pint of her father's home brewed ale. It
was a thing not well understood&mdash;had no right to be,
doubtless they thought. The little church was crammed.
Needless to say that every member of the Wonder Club
was present, and, lo, here comes the vicar of Littleboro',
that aged and somewhat infirm cleric of benevolent
aspect, and all the aristocracy of the place.</p>

<p>The service begins. Mr. Parnassus has been chosen
as best man, and has composed an ode for the occasion.
Mr. Oldstone has begged the honour of giving away the
bride, which duty he performs with great dignity. A
dead silence reigns as the bridegroom places the ring
on the chubby finger of his bride. The benediction is
given, the register is signed, <i>et c'est une affaire fini</i>. The<span class='pagenum'>633</span>
bridal pair march out of church to the joyous strains of
the organ, treading beneath their feet along the aisle the
flowers that friendly rustics have strewn across their
path. Bride and bridegroom then step into their
carriage and drive back to the house of the bride, where
a sumptuous wedding breakfast awaits them. Nor were
the wedding presents wanting. The members of the
club had subscribed, and presented the pair with a
handsome punch-bowl and silver ladle with the usual
golden guinea inlaid in the scoop. The parents of the
bride presented their daughter with a handsome piece
of carved oak furniture called a "brideswain," dating
back as far as the commonwealth, which contained
linen, goblets, and other useful articles.</p>

<p>The old broadbacked farmer, the bride's godfather,
who was present, and whom our readers will recollect
was the innocent cause of the disasters that followed,
in that, in his simplicity, he had put Lord Scampford's
bully into possession of the secret of Helen's address,
that day at the Royal Academy; well, the bride's godfather
and his spouse between them presented the
couple with a metal dish and cover, besides a case containing
a carving knife, fork, and steel. The bride's
aunt, whom we have mentioned as an invalid, sent an
expensive old-fashioned china tea service and sundry
chimney ornaments, while her friends in humbler circumstances
each contributed their little mite.</p>

<p>The breakfast went off merrily. The speeches and
the toasts, who shall describe?<span class='pagenum'>634</span></p>

<p>At length the hour of parting arrived. The carriage
drove up, and the bridal pair entered amid showers of
rice and old slippers. Our hero and heroine were
about to set out on a continental tour for their honeymoon,
and intended visiting the eternal city.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most touching incident of all occurred
at the last moment, just as the happy pair were entering
their carriage.</p>

<p>Mr. Oldstone, who had been very moist on the
occasion, drew off his antique ring, of which we have
heard so much, from his forefinger and placed it on
that of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, saying with much emotion:
"Take it, my son; take it with an old man's blessing.
Preserve it as an heirloom, for I shall never wear it
more."</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>"Poor old man!" said our artist with some emotion,
when they had left the home of the bride a mile behind.
"To think that he should make <i>me</i> this valuable
present, and that I hadn't time to thank him at the last.
I must write to him on the very first opportunity. Why,
Helen, can you guess the value of this gem? I would
sooner possess this ring than all the money he has in
the world. I never thought he would give it away to
anyone during his lifetime. Did you ever hear the
legend attached to it?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes; I think I <i>was</i> present when Mr.
Oldstone told his story," said Helen; "but I am sure I<span class='pagenum'>635</span>
don't recollect anything about it now. You shall tell it
to me over again some other time, darling."</p>

<p>"With pleasure, dearest," replied her husband. "It
is a long story, and at present we have so many other
things to think of, haven't we, love?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," was the reply.</p>

<p>"And you think you will continue to love me as
much as you did at first, darling?" demanded the newly
married man of his young wife.</p>

<p>"Oh! Van; how can you ask such a question?"
exclaimed the bride. "Why, I love you more and more
every minute."</p>

<p>"Then give hubby a pretty kiss," was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>Two pouting rosebuds were thrust upwards into the
husband's face, upon which he settled like a bee upon
a flower extracting nectar and ambrosia; and thus we
will leave them.</p>



<hr style="width: 80%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'>636</span></p>
<h2>L'ENVOI.</h2>


<p>A universal gloom pervaded the precincts of the
Wonder Club since the departure of the happy pair,
which none felt more than Mr. Oldstone. Not but that
he was delighted at the union of his prot&eacute;g&eacute; with the
landlord's pretty daughter, whom he begrudged to anyone
short of a gentleman. That his dear Helen, whom
he loved as his own child, should have had the good
fortune to marry, not only a gentleman, but the very
one that he himself would have singled out for her, was
the realization of his happiest dreams. He knew they
were happy, and revelled in the thought of their happiness.
Still, they had gone out of his life and formed
one of their own, apart. Her sunny smile would no
more light up the dingy walls of the old hostel. He
would hear no more the ring of her merry laugh, could
no longer peer into her deep blue eyes, nor delight in
her exquisitely white teeth, her rosy cheeks or coral lips;
and added to this, his health that had for some time
past been failing him, now thoroughly broke down, and
he knew his end was not far off. So he penned a letter
to his friend Rustcoin, who was still living in Rome, to
come over to see him before he died, as he had much
to say to him.<span class='pagenum'>637</span></p>

<p>Besides the breaking down of our antiquary's health,
the club itself, as if by one accord, began to break up.
Mr. Blackdeed went to London and became manager of
a large theatre. Dr. Bleedem also retired to a fashionable
quarter of the metropolis, where he soon had an
extensive practice. Mr. Parnassus became editor of a
paper at Bath, and published a volume of poems.
Professor Cyanite and Mr. Crucible likewise disappeared.
The former travelled about the country
giving lectures on geology. The latter bought a house
near town, where he pursued his studies in chemistry.</p>

<p>Thus our antiquary was now left quite alone; <i>i.e.</i>,
with the exception of Mr. Hardcase. He managed to
pass the time by writing voluminously, as if he intended
to finish some important work before he died. In his
intervals of rest from his labours, he would frequently
take solitary rambles in the woods adjacent to the inn,
or along one of the cross roads. On one of these
excursions his footsteps led him to the old churchyard
of Littleboro' with its old yews and cypress. As he
entered the gate, the sexton was at work digging a
grave. The man ceased his labour at his approach;
and, seating himself on the edge, began to fill his pipe,
which he next lighted and began puffing at, apparently
oblivious of anybody's presence.</p>

<p>It must be stated that the sexton was looked upon
as a character in the village. Certainly he was a strange
looking object. He was very old and decrepit, exceedingly
bow-legged, had a bald, mis-shapen head. Was<span class='pagenum'>638</span>
toothless, hollow-eyed, with features that suggested a
skull. He was stone deaf, and had, moreover, acquired
a habit of uttering his thoughts aloud, whoever might be
present, perfectly unconscious that he could be overheard.
If addressed, he never gave himself any trouble
to catch the meaning of his interlocutor, but always fluked
an answer such as he deemed ought to fit the question.</p>

<p>Thus, when our antiquary approached with a "Good
morning, Delves. Hard at work, I see. Whose grave
may you be working at, now?" he received for answer,
"Thank you, sir; I'm very well. Yes, as you say, it <i>be</i>
remarkable fine weather for this time o' the year, sure<i>ly</i>."</p>

<p>"But I didn't make any remark about the weather,
Delves," persisted Oldstone. "You didn't understand
me."</p>

<p>The sexton made no reply, nor looked the antiquary
in the face, but muttered very audibly to himself, "That
be one o' them old fools of the Wonder Club&mdash;<i>Wonder
Club</i>, indeed; ha! ha!" Here he gave vent to a
mocking laugh. Then, "He should see some o' my
wonders."</p>

<p>Our antiquary was accustomed to the eccentricities
of this worthy, who was generally looked upon as a
harmless idiot; but when he heard the Wonder Club
sneered at, he took deep offence, and was about to utter
some rebuke, when the grave-digger began muttering
again to himself, and Oldstone, whose curiosity was
being roused, forbore to speak, and thought he would
listen instead.<span class='pagenum'>639</span></p>

<p>"A little knows I seed un's corpse candle last night,
he, he! Ay, he'll be the next. They can't, none o'
them, fool me. Whenever they've got to die, old Delves
allers sees their corpse candles fust. Wasn't I right
before Lord Scampford and his bully met with their
death, eh? Didn't I say that only one on' o' 'em ud be
buried in this here churchyard, and wasn't one on 'em
buried in that there corner just as I prognosticated, and
didn't I see the corpse candle of 'is lordship go along
the road towards London? They allers lets me know
beforehand, my customers. Now, there's this here gent,
the <i>h</i>antiquary, as they calls him&mdash;if I didn't see 'uns
corpse candle last night a leavin' the <i>h</i>inn o' the
''Eadless Lady,' and settle down on this wery spot
where 'e's a standin', I'll be shot, that's all. If a's not
doo to-morrer, or next day, 'e's doo within this week.
I never knowed one live more nor a week after I'd seen
'uns corpse candle."</p>

<p>Our antiquary, now intensely interested, determined
to interrogate him anew, so he bawled out as loud as he
could in his ear, making a trumpet of his hands, "Whose
grave did you say that was?"</p>

<p>"Yourn, zur," replied the sexton, with a grin.</p>

<p>"Mine!" exclaimed the antiquary, starting back:
"but I'm not dead yet."</p>

<p>"Not dead yet&mdash;ain't ye; he, he! Well, you soon
will be; ho, ho! I'll give ye three days. I don't think
ye'll last longer nor that; but there's where you've got
to lie, willy-nilly," said the sexton, pointing to the grave.<span class='pagenum'>640</span></p>

<p>"You are making very sure of me," remarked the
antiquary, with a grim smile.</p>

<p>"Ay, by &mdash;&mdash;, I am," rejoined the grave-digger,
"for when I've once seen a man's corpse candle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There is no knowing how much longer the conversation
might have lasted, if at this moment two villagers
had not entered the churchyard, so Oldstone, not wishing
to be overheard, nodded to the sexton, and added,
"Till we meet again." He then bent his steps towards
the inn, and, arriving there, was greeted by his friend
Rustcoin, who had just arrived. It was years since
these two friends had met, and doubtless each found
the other vastly changed.</p>

<p>"Why, surely, old friend, you are not so bad as you
try to make out," observed Rustcoin. "You look hale
and hearty still. You are up, and walking about."</p>

<p>"Well, do you know how much longer they give me
to live?" asked Oldstone.</p>

<p>"No. Who?" inquired Rustcoin. "The doctor?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly. A prophet."</p>

<p>"A prophet, eh? That's interesting; and who
may this prophet be, if I might ask?"</p>

<p>"The grave-digger."</p>

<p>"The grave-digger! What does he know about it?"</p>

<p>"Says he saw my corpse candle last night, and he
is at this moment digging my grave on the strength
of it."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, you're joking. Pray, don't give
these sort of people any encouragement in their anti<span class='pagenum'>641</span>quated
superstitions. You were always given a little
that way yourself, I remember."</p>

<p>"Come, let's go inside, and have lunch together.
You are, doubtless, hungry," said Oldstone. "We'll
have a good long chat over our meal." Then leaning
on his friend's arm, both entered the inn.</p>

<p>Our host and hostess were, of course, delighted at
the arrival of the long-absent member, and many
allusions were made to old times. Dame Hearty
hastily laid the cloth, brought in the lunch of cold beef
and pickles, the remains of a rabbit pie, some bread
and cheese, with a jug of nut-brown ale, home-brewed
and left the two companions to themselves.</p>

<p>"And so our young friend, Vandyke McGuilp, has
gone and made a d&mdash;&mdash;d fool of himself," said Rustcoin,
after a pause in the conversation. "Well, I thought
him a more sensible man. What! one of <i>his</i> talent
and position to sink himself to the level of a dish-clout!
Why! it's sheer madness."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow; don't talk like that," cried Oldstone.
"If you'd only seen the girl, I assure you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bah! I make no doubt but that she's pretty&mdash;that's
not the point. You won't pretend that she was
any better educated than the rest of her class," maintained
Rustcoin.</p>

<p>"Educated! <i>educated!</i>" exclaimed Oldstone. "She
had something in her far beyond what <i>you</i> would call
education&mdash;by which you probably mean book learning,
or that flimsy social veneer which anyone can acquire<span class='pagenum'>642</span>
who chooses to move within the radius of a certain
narrow circle, where all is artificial, unreal, cold, hypocritical,
and false. This is a girl of character, truth-loving,
sweet, and unselfish&mdash;pure as an angel&mdash;intelligent,
and with fine sensibilities."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," broke in Rustcoin, testily. "These
country wenches are ever stubborn, hard-headed, self-interested,
exacting, undocile, unteachable. Peasant
she was born, and peasant she will remain to the end of
her days. God help the poor idiot with such a one for
a mate! She may be well enough as a wife to some
country bumpkin, but for any rational being to hamper
himself with one of these clods&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But she's not one of these clods," persisted
Oldstone. "I tell you this is quite an exceptional
case."</p>

<p>"Just because she is pretty, forsooth," interposed
Rustcoin. "I believe you are gone on her yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh! as for me&mdash;I love her as my own daughter,"
replied Oldstone. "I've seen her grow up from a child,
and have had plenty of time to study her disposition.
I have ever found her dutiful to her parents, diligent in
her duties, naturally intelligent, and of the highest
principle. Her surroundings have not been altogether
those that fall to the lot of a girl of that class, and she
possesses all the qualities that any rational man should
expect in a wife."</p>

<p>"Such a paragon as you describe, I confess, never
came within my experience, and I have gone through<span class='pagenum'>643</span>
something in my youth. More than once I have been
on the point of making a fool of myself. At the time,
I thought my goddess the most perfect being in creation,
but I was soon undeceived in every case, and now I
thank my stars that I have always managed to steer
clear of trouble, and have remained an old bachelor."</p>

<p>It was the third day since Rustcoin had appeared
upon the scene, since which time Oldstone had been
sinking fast. At this moment he was seated, propped
up by cushions, in an easy chair, in dressing gown
and night cap. His friend Rustcoin was by his side,
receiving instructions as to the publication of a pile
of MSS, whilst Mr. Hardcase, the lawyer, whom we
have mentioned as still being on the spot after the
others had left, was now engaged in putting the
antiquary's will into legal form.</p>

<p>Dr. Bleedem having retired to London, his successor,
Dr. Dosemore, had been called in to attend the patient.
He could do no more however than his predecessor
had done&mdash;viz., to warn him of his approaching end
informing him that he would succumb to internal
gout, which would encroach upon his system, until it
reached the heart, when it would take him off suddenly.
The new doctor had just left the room, and the
antiquary was addressing his old friend in feeble tones,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This pile of MSS," he said, "is a collection of
tales, which I have jotted down from memory as
nearly as possible in the words of the narrators, and<span class='pagenum'>644</span>
which I desire to be bound and published, under the
title of 'Tales of the Wonder Club, by Dryasdust.' I
believe I am conferring a boon upon society in rescuing
these precious documents from oblivion, and publishing
them broadcast, for the benefit of humanity at large.
See that they be illustrated by the first artists of the
day, so that the book may obtain all the readier sale.
So shall my soul rest in peace, and my blessing remain
with those I leave behind. Tell my young friend
Vandyke that my last thoughts were of him and
his fair bride." Then extending one hand to his friend
Rustcoin and the other to the lawyer, he sank back on
his cushions and spoke no more.</p>

<p>"So he has gone at last, the poor old gentleman,"
said Hardcase, disengaging his hand from that of the
corpse.</p>

<p>"Ay, just <i>three days</i> from my arrival, as predicted
by the sexton&mdash;strange, isn't it?" remarked Rustcoin.
"What a fine old head it is. It's a pity a cast should
not be taken of it. I should so like to possess a bust of
my old friend."</p>

<p>"Nothing is easier," said the lawyer. "I will get
the new doctor to take one. I know he can, because
he told me so."</p>

<p>Dr. Dosemore was immediately recalled, and before
the day was over, a successful mould was taken of the
face, which, with as little delay as possible, Rustcoin
despatched to Rome, to a sculptor friend of his of
some renown, with injunctions to execute for him a<span class='pagenum'>645</span>
bust of his old friend, in the best Carrara marble, with
pedestal of scagliola.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>The bell was tolling at the old church of Littleboro'.
A solemn procession, all clad in deep
mourning, entered the churchyard gate, and followed
the coffin to the grave. The sexton was at his post,
bearing a certain air of triumph about him, as if he
were saying to himself, "There, I told you so. They
can't none of 'em fool me. What I perdicts is <i>sartin</i>."</p>

<p>The same old vicar who so lately had joined together
the hands of our hero and heroine in holy matrimony
has now a sadder task to perform. Our host and
hostess, of course, are present, as well as our friends
Hardcase, Rustcoin, and the new doctor, besides several
strangers. All stand reverently bareheaded during the
reading of the burial service, until the usual three handfuls
of earth are strewn upon the coffin, after which the
sexton, with a deft and businesslike, though hardly a
reverent manner, tumbles the earth hurriedly on to the
top of the coffin, and all is over.</p>

<p>Soon after the ceremony Rustcoin and Hardcase
take leave of each other, and likewise of our host and
hostess, when each departs by a different route. Rustcoin
returns no more to Rome, but settles in York, his
native town, where he purchased a house, which he has
been at some pains to fit up according to his tastes.
Over the mantelpiece in his study hangs the portrait of<span class='pagenum'>646</span>
his brother antiquary, painted by our artist, Vandyke
McGuilp, while in a corner of the room is a well
executed bust in the best Carrara white marble, representing
the same features. He has also inherited the
whole of his friend Oldstone's collection of antiquities,
which are now added to his own, and make, together, a
very respectable museum, which he is ever proud of
showing to his visitors when they call.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>Let us now return to the hostel of the "Headless
Lady," where our host and hostess are left alone in their
glory, for even Mr. Hardcase has at length taken his
departure and settled in some neighbouring town. They
are seated at some distance apart from each other, no
longer looking tenderly and lovingly into each others'
faces as of yore, but askance, as if they had had some
matrimonial quarrel, which neither felt inclined to be the
first to make up. Jack Hearty's hands are thrust deeply
into his pockets, his legs extended, his brows knit, and
his eyes fixed upon the ground; while his spouse,
usually so active and so busy, to whom nothing was
greater pain than being forced to be idle, was now
lolling in a listless attitude, her arms dangling idly at
her sides with an expression on her face of the most
intense boredom. One who knew them both would no
longer recognise in these two melancholy persons our
jovial host and hostess of former days.<span class='pagenum'>647</span></p>

<p>"Tell you what it is, Molly," began Jack, at length,
"D&mdash;&mdash;d if I don't think this house is haunted."</p>

<p>"Why so, Jack?" enquired the dame, wearily.</p>

<p>"Have you not noticed since Mr. Oldstone's death&mdash;nay,
before&mdash;ever since our dear Helen left her home,
that a curse seems to have fallen upon this house?"
demanded Jack.</p>

<p>"True, I feel an unaccountable depression of spirits,
but still I thought it nothing but the weather," rejoined
his spouse.</p>

<p>"It's not that only," persisted her husband. "Fair
or foul weather, it is just the same to me. See how
our custom has fallen off."</p>

<p>"Naturally; now that the members of the club have
all departed," replied Molly. "It's lonely like, not
seeing a human face all day long."</p>

<p>"It's worse than that," continued Jack. "Haven't
you felt&mdash;well, I don't know how to say it&mdash;as if&mdash;as
if&mdash;some danger were hanging over our heads?"</p>

<p>"Lor, Jack!" cried our hostess, "Who'ld ever have
thought to hear <i>you</i> talk like that? Well, Jack, to tell
you the truth&mdash;though I never liked to mention the
matter before, for fear you should laugh at me&mdash;I confess
I never <i>have</i> felt quite myself since the night of that
tragedy."</p>

<p>"That's it. Depend upon it," said her husband.
"The spot has become accursed. I lose my appetite
and sleep; feel weak and nervous; start at the merest
sound, while ever and anon I have the sensation as if<span class='pagenum'>648</span>
someone were looking over my shoulder. If perchance
I shut my eyes, I see before me all that took place upon
that fearful night. I hear the stairs creak, and see that
ruffian clasping our dear Helen in his arms. I hear her
screams for help, whilst I seem to see myself lying
drugged and helpless, incapable of running to her
assistance."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack! and so have I," replied his spouse.
"I too have dreamed that dream. It will not go from
me. Each time I close my eyes&mdash;&mdash; Hark! What was
that? A footstep, I'll be sworn."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," assented Jack; "I hear them oft, myself."</p>

<p>It was now growing late, and our host went to fetch
a jug of his own nut brown ale, and filled himself up a
glass, which he drained at a draught, then filled himself
up another.</p>

<p>"You drink more than you used to, Jack," remarked
the wife of his bosom. "I've seen you look very muddled
of late. Don't let it grow upon you. Don't, now,
there's a dear."</p>

<p>But to his wife's tender injunctions he turned a deaf
ear, and continued to fill up again and again, and yet
again, until he was perfectly mellow.</p>

<p>"Oh! Jack, Jack," cried Dame Hearty, despairingly,
"I knew how it would be. Don't, don't; you'll break
my heart."</p>

<p>"What the &mdash;&mdash; does it matter to you?" demanded
her husband, "'s long 's I leave you alone (hic)."</p>

<p>Here some altercation took place between the two<span class='pagenum'>649</span>
which we will not record; as, in such moods, our
landlord was rarely very choice in his language. It
was with considerable difficulty that Dame Hearty
succeeded at length in getting her worse half upstairs
and to bed.</p>

<p>We grieve to be obliged to record that on the
following night there was a repetition of this painful
scene, and the night after that, too. In spite of his
poor wife's prayers and entreaties, he grew from bad to
worse. Jack Hearty had become a confirmed drunkard.
When in his cups his nature appeared completely
changed. He who, up to the present, had enjoyed the
reputation of being the kindest and most loving of
husbands, the most genial of men, had now become
morose, coarse, blasphemous, cantankerous, and cruel.
His poor wife was in despair, and could do nothing but
cry or go into hysterics.</p>

<p>It was one stormy night, when our host of the
"Headless Lady" had dragged himself upstairs more
intoxicated than ever, that he let fall the candle, which
immediately set fire to the bed curtains, and in an
instant the room was in flames. Our host was so dazed
as to be incapable of saving himself, and if it had not
been for Dame Hearty's presence of mind, who managed
to drag her husband downstairs in time, both might
have perished in the flames.</p>

<p>The position of the inn, as we know, was isolated.
Before help could be procured the fine old hostel, that
had stood for centuries, and whose walls had resounded<span class='pagenum'>650</span>
so long with the mirth and laughter of our jovial
members, was now a charred and shapeless ruin.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>"Well, Jack, I hope you're satisfied now," said his
better-half, as the loving couple tucked themselves into
a spare bed at the house of a neighbour, who had taken
them in out of charity.</p>

<p>Our host was now quite sober, having had to walk a
mile at least through the bleak wind and driving snow,
so he turned, in a humbled and penitent manner,
towards his wife, crying, "Oh, Molly, Molly, how can
you ever forgive me? Oh! what a fool I have been!
If I had only listened to you at first. But, there&mdash;it's
the drink&mdash;the cursed drink&mdash;that makes a beast of a
man. I vow I will never touch a drop of drink again
as long as I live."</p>

<p>"Dear Jack, I believe you," replied his spouse.
"Be your old self again," and with one loving kiss all
past troubles were forgotten.</p>

<p>"Ah! Molly, Molly, you're something like a wife.
Never will I for the future give you any cause for complaint."</p>

<p>And he kept his word. Jack Hearty was a reformed
man.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>We now approach the end of our story. Our hero
and heroine, after a prolonged honeymoon in the sunny<span class='pagenum'>651</span>
south, which to Helen was like a dream of Paradise,
found themselves reluctantly compelled to return to
England in order to superintend certain matters of
business connected with their country house and estate.
Soon after their return, our married couple, wishing to
give the old people an agreeable surprise, proposed paying
them a visit in their carriage and pair, at their old
home, the "Headless Lady." What was their surprise
and dismay, on their arrival, to find, in lieu of the time
honoured hostel, <i>a blackened ruin</i>!</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" cried husband and wife, simultaneously,
"what can have become of the old people?"
Tears started to the eyes of Helen at the thought of the
scenes of her childhood and of the many happy hours
she had spent within those old walls; but anxiety for
the fate of her parents filled her soul. Enquiries having
been made, Jack Hearty and his wife were tracked to
the house of a neighbour in the village.</p>

<p>"Father! Mother!" cried the grand lady, stepping
out of her carriage; and, throwing all ceremony to the
winds, she embraced them both with the fondest
affection, while the liveried coachman and footman
exchanged glances together.</p>

<p>"Tell us how all this has happened," said our artist;
"but first step into the carriage, and we will drive
home. You must come and stay with us."</p>

<p>Neither his father nor his mother-in-law possessed
anything but what they stood upright in, and were not
long in making up their minds, so stepping into the<span class='pagenum'>652</span>
carriage, and waving an adieu to their hospitable neighbours,
were soon borne out of sight.</p>

<p>"Well, Jack," said our artist to his father-in-law,
after he had listened to a detailed account of the latter's
misadventure, as they were sitting together that evening
in the cosy parlour of our hero's country house, the two
ladies having retired to the drawing-room to enjoy their
own private gossip, "of course I am sorry for your loss,
and for the old inn itself, which I had calculated making
a picture of some day; but really, under the circumstances,
I look upon it as providential."</p>

<p>"Providential!" exclaimed the <i>ci-devant</i> landlord,
in astonishment. "What! the destruction of the home
of my fathers by fire, through my idiotic folly and
besotted drunkenness, providential!"</p>

<p>"Jack, my boy, you were but the instrument, and
no responsible agent," continued his son-in-law. "From
what you tell me, the house was most undoubtedly
haunted&mdash;the air vitiated and poisoned as by a pestilence,
from having been the seat of deep crime. I know
something of these phenomena, and I have always heard
and read that there is no thorough or lasting purification
in such cases save by <i>fire</i>. Take, for example, the Fire
of London. That broke out, providentially, after the
Plague, in order to purify the City. The burning of
your inn was a necessity, as it had been rendered
uninhabitable through being haunted, and you were
chosen as the instrument."</p>

<p>"Why! Good Heavens!" cried Jack  Hearty,<span class='pagenum'>653</span>
drawing his chair suddenly back, and looking straight
into the face of his son-in-law, while a fat hand rested
on each stout knee. "To think that that should never
have occurred to me before! Why, of course, it must
have been so. I see it all as plain as a pike-staff."</p>

<p>"You were not yourself, Jack, on that occasion,"
pursued our artist. "You were <i>beside</i> yourself, which
means that your will, already unfeebled, was subjugated
by some outside power&mdash;viz., the will of some disembodied
spirit stronger than your own, who made use
of you as his instrument."</p>

<p>"It is quite true, sir," replied Jack, "I was <i>not</i> myself
at the time. Well, well&mdash;it is some consolation to think
it <i>had</i> to be done, and that there was no way out of it."</p>

<p>Here the ladies re-entered the room, and the
conversation took another turn.</p>

<p>"Now, Jack," proposed McGuilp, before all present,
"since matters have turned out thus, what do you say to
becoming steward of my estate&mdash;my man of business&mdash;caretaker
of my house when I am away, and live here
with the missus to the end of your days?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir!" exclaimed Jack Hearty and his wife
together, "you overwhelm us with kindness. How
can we ever repay you our debt of gratitude?" and
tears started to the eyes of the old couple.</p>

<p>"Then so be it," said the now rich landowner.</p>

<p>"Dear, <i>dear</i>, Van!" exclaimed his young wife, as
she threw herself upon his neck and covered him with
kisses. "You have made me <i>so</i> happy."<span class='pagenum'>654</span></p>

<p>And so it was that the little family party jogged on
from day to day as united as birds in a nest.</p>

<p>Jack Hearty was a good man of business, and an
honest, and the post suited him to a T. Dame Hearty's
delight was naturally to cook and to wash, or in undertaking
any of those rough duties that she had been
accustomed to in her former life, but as these were
not necessary&mdash;others having been engaged for that
purpose, she was entrusted with the keys of the house,
and became an excellent housekeeper, loved and
respected by those under her.</p>

<p>Had our artist entirely abandoned art now that he
had succeeded to his uncle's fortune and estate? Far
from it. First and foremost among the improvements
that he made was the building of a spacious studio,
which he fitted up in a manner worthy of his taste and
his means. In this he executed his great picture, which
created such a <i>furore</i> on the following year at the Royal
Academy, entitled, "Captured by the Brigands." The
English captive in the composition was a faithful likeness
of our artist himself, whilst the bronzed features of his
captors, which were deeply impressed upon his memory
were as like to the originals, our artist assures us, as if
they had sat for them. The time is represented as
towards evening. The light and shade powerful. The
whole effect of the picture weird and unearthly. An
offer had been made for it, but the would-be buyer was
informed that it was not for sale. So it was hung up in
the parlour of the artist's own country house, according<span class='pagenum'>655</span>
to the wish of his loving wife, who liked constantly to be
reminded of this weird episode in the life of the man
she loved.</p>

<p>Time wore on, and not a quarrel, not a difference
of opinion even arose to mar the happiness of this
loving pair, when one fine morning a great event
transpired. The lady of this household presented her
liege lord with a son and heir, a fine healthy boy, who
was christened John, after his grandfather, and never
called other than Jack by his parents. Despite her
household duties, Mrs. Vandyke McGuilp always
managed to find time to pursue her studies, while her
natural intelligence and application were such that
the progress she made under her husband's tuition,
was simply marvellous. In a few years the McGuilps
purchased a house in town in a fashionable quarter,
and the "at homes" or "conversaziones," as they were
called in those days, of Mrs. Vandyke McGuilp, were
the talk of all the <i>elite</i>. Helen now felt herself called
upon to enact the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of a grand lady, and in this her
natural dignity, intelligence, and sweetness of disposition,
enabled her to succeed to perfection.</p>

<p>Little more remains to be told. After a few seasons
in town, and having run the usual curriculum of operas,
balls, parties, concerts, visiting, and even presentation
at court, the sameness and artificiality of such an existence
palled upon these two artless and ingenuous lovers
of nature, so the house in town was at length given up,
and our artist retired into the country, where he gave<span class='pagenum'>656</span>
up his time more thoroughly to the study of his art,
working ever with increased ardour through the kind
encouragement and sympathy of his loving wife.</p>

<p>Nor was Mrs. Vandyke McGuilp forgetful of her old
friends. She fondly cherished the memory of her dear
Mr. Oldstone, her friend and adviser, and it grieved her
that she had not been able to be near him and attend
upon him during his last moments on earth. She had
also made the acquaintance of Mr. Rustcoin, who frequently
called upon them. Had even been to their
"at homes" when they lived in London. This gentleman
had become quite reconciled to the idea of his
friend Vandyke McGuilp's marriage with the daughter
of a country innkeeper, and agreed with his friend
Oldstone that this was quite an exceptional case. He
had even been heard to declare before a company of
friends that the most charming woman he had ever
met for intelligence, natural grace, sound sense, good
heartedness, tact, and <i>savoir faire</i>, was the wife of his
friend Mr. Vandyke McGuilp.</p>

<p>A few years later, when it fell to Mr. Rustcoin's turn
to pay the debt of nature, this gentleman recollecting
how fondly the memory of his friend Oldstone was
cherished by those two charming people, the McGuilps,
having presented his large collection of antiquities to his
native city of York, bequeathed to our friends both the
bust and the oil picture of his brother antiquary, which
latter, our readers will remember, was painted by the
hand of our artist himself<span class='pagenum'>657</span>.</p>

<p>Our friend Rustcoin has now long gone to his rest,
and both bust and portrait of Mr. Oldstone adorn the
country mansion of the McGuilps. Among other
cherished relics of their friend is a bound and illustrated
work conspicuously placed in their library, entitled:
"Tales of the Wonder Club," by Dryasdust, out of
which volume little Jack McGuilp often pesters his
mother to read a story to him.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>


<p>In conclusion, let me beg the reader to accompany
me in imagination to the site of the once far-famed old
Elizabethan hostelry, "The Headless Lady" and what
do we see? Alas! not even the old blackened ruin is
there to mark the spot. All, <i>all</i>, has been swept away
by the ruthless hand of modern civilisation.</p>

</div>

<p>How is the whole face of the country changed!
The stately elms and beeches, with the rooks' nests
lodging in their branches, have been cut down to satisfy
the greed of this utilitarian age. The land has been
bought up in our time by a railway company, and
crowded trains, with their screeching railway whistle,
rush over the very site of this ancient hostelry, whose
walls once resounded with the songs and applause of
our friends of the "Wonder Club." Not even the
picturesque old church of Littleborough has been spared.
Being pronounced unsafe, it was pulled down, and on
<span class='pagenum'>659</span>
its site erected a modern Baptist chapel, in all that
unsightly ugliness of style so cherished by dissenters.
How strange that religious bodies should have such
execrable taste. Telegraph lines cross and recross each
other in every direction, and railway bridges, tunnels
and aqueducts abound on all hands.</p>

<p>The town of Muddleton-upon-Slush, once little more
than a village, has swelled to the proportions of a
prosperous factory town, with its smoky chimneys, its
gasometers, its rows upon rows of jerry-built houses, its
new town hall, its salvation army barracks, its police
station, its chapels of every conceivable denomination, to
say nothing of its numerous public-houses, young men's
Christian association, its baths and wash-houses, its low
theatre, where questionable pieces are represented by
indifferent actors to pander to the modern taste. Then
its placards and pictorial advertisements, who shall tell?
But, enough. As for the old fashioned honest English
rustic of the past, with his sturdiness of character and
devout unquestioning faith in matters of religion, <i>his</i>
genus is quite extinct; you may possibly stumble upon
his fossil in a stratum of London blue clay. He has
been superseded by quite a distinct species&mdash;the modern
blackguard, with his blatant scepticism and blasphemous
irreligion.</p>

<p>It might have been some forty years ago since the
author, who was travelling on a matter of urgent business
on this line, was roused in the midst of a reverie
by the guard calling out, "Muddleton-upon-Slush!<span class='pagenum'>660</span>
Any passengers for Muddleton?" As this was my
destination I descended, and was about to cross the
railway bridge when I observed an aged and reverend
looking individual, whose low crowned hat with its
broad brim, and the severe cut of whose sad coloured
clothes proclaimed him a member of the "Society of
Friends," a genuine quaker of the true old fashioned
stamp, long since extinct. He was in earnest discourse
with the porter, and as I passed him I caught these
words, uttered in tones deliberate and slow, as one who
has the whole day before him, and sees no necessity for
hurry, and which contrasted strangely with the bustle
and confusion going on around him.</p>

<p>"Prithee, friend, canst thou direct me to the ancient
hostel of the 'Headless Lady'?"</p>

<p>"The <i>what</i>? The ''Eadless Lady.' No, sir.
There ain't no public 'ouse about 'ere of that name,"
was the porter's curt reply. "But if it's a glass of <i>h</i>ale
you want, sir, there's the '<i>H</i>angel and the <i>H</i>eagle,' the
'<i>H</i>elephant and Castle,' and the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doubtless, friend," interrupted the reverend individual,
"there are enough and to spare of those abominations,
those dens of iniquity that the lost sheep of the
house of Israel denominate public houses; but know,
friend, that it is not ale I seek, seeing that I am a
follower of one Rechab, who, as doubtless thou wilt
have read in Holy Writ, indulged neither in wine nor
strong drink."</p>

<p>The porter's face throughout this sententious speech<span class='pagenum'>661</span>
was a study. His eyes and mouth gradually opened
till they reached their utmost limit. Then suddenly
recollecting that his manner might appear rude, he
broke in with:</p>

<p>"Well, sir, if you should prefer a good rump steak
and a cup of tea, I could recommend&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Verily, friend," again interrupted the quaker,
"thou comprehendest me not, for neither doth my soul
hanker after the fleshpots of Egypt, but having a taste
for antiquarian lore, I would fain revisit that spot of
historic interest once seen in my youth, but of which I
have now no clear recollection, namely the hostel of the
'Headless Lady.'"</p>

<p>"''Eadless Lady'! ''<i>Eadless Lady</i>'! Why, God
bless my soul, sir, where <i>h</i>ever do you 'ail from? Why,
now I come to think of it, I remember to have 'eerd
my grandfather speak of it. Lor, sir, it's been burnt
down this 'alf a century ago."</p>

<p>"Burnt down!" exclaimed the antiquary, in extreme
vexation.</p>

<p>"Yessir," replied the porter, briskly, "burnt down
by the landlord hisself, when in his cups, as I've heered
say&mdash;down to the wery ground. There, sir, is the spot,
where I'm p'inting. Yessir, that's where it stood.
This here line runs right bang over the wery site of it."</p>

<p>"Bless me!" cried the disappointed quaker in
dismay, "and have I left my peaceful home, that I
havn't stirred out of for years to hear this? Verily, all
is vanity."<span class='pagenum'>662</span></p>

<p>Here he would have begun a homily on the evils of
intemperance, had not the guard interrupted him with:</p>

<p>"Yessir, I remember to have 'eerd my grandfather
say, when I was a kid, on'y so high" (here he lowered
the palm of his hand to within a couple of feet of the
platform), "as 'ow the 'ouse was 'aunted by the ghost of
a nun, as valked about vith 'er 'ead <i>h</i>under 'er <i>h</i>arm,
but that's a long while ago, that is. No, sir, you may
depend upon it, there <i>h</i>ain't no 'eadless ladies valking
about now, sir.  <i>Ve</i> don't believe in 'em nowadays."</p>

<p>With this, he took up a rasping iron bell, which he
rang so vigorously that the peaceful quaker was fain to
stop his ears and hurry from the spot as fast as his legs
could carry him.</p>

<p>"Poor old gent," muttered the porter, to himself, as
he looked after him, "'e <i>h</i>ain't <i>h</i>up to date, no 'ow."</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
